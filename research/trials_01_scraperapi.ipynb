       "  'review': \"I have a larger head for a woman, probably about the size of average dudes. The headphones feel very tight and give me a headache after about 10 minutes of wearing them. I'm constantly adjusting them to move the pressure on to a different part of my ear. My ears are not that large but the headphone ear pieces are on the small side so they have to sit on the ear in some way.The sound quality is okay for budget headphones. Build quality is decent, better than generic brands from China.I do like how light and portable they are for this type of headphone. They fold up easily and don't take up much space when you throw them down on your desk. This makes them easy to use and access and that's the main reason that has earned it 3 stars. The white colour is pretty enough.Overall I'm satisfied but may be giving these to my 7 year old daughter if I can't manage to find a way to avoid getting headaches wearing these.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'I purchased these headphones in November 2022 and am finally putting them to rest today, May 2024.I got them on sale for $25 for studying as I started my graduate program.PROS:1. Personally, I don\\'t like 100% noise-canceling headphones because I like to be aware of my surroundings and if people are trying to talk to me. But they cancel ENOUGH of background noise to keep my ADHD attention span in check. So if you want to completely ignore the world, these may not be for you. The sound quality is very loud and clear, and the volume doesn\\'t have to be turned up that much, either.2. SO DURABLE. I am surprised these lasted for as long as they did. I was waiting for them to crap out a year ago with how I was using them. I take them to the gym; sweating on the \"earmuff\" part was kind of gross, but I cleaned it with alcohol after, and it still held up great. These have also been my go-to for traveling. I\\'ve brought them on many plane rides, fallen asleep with them in weird angles, shoved them in many PACKED backpacks and suitcases, and have been dropped quite a bit. STILL WORKED AND SOUNDED BEAUTIFULLY.3. Battery life is nearly immortal. I forget to charge these because of how long they last. I used them all week to study, maybe 4-5 hours a day, 5 days a week, and would charge them every two weeks or so.4. I also use these for work calls and Zoom meetings, and they have worked better than any of my expensive Galaxy Buds or whatever Anker earbuds.CONS:1. Mishapen. I\\'m not even mad about this. Maybe I have a big head or maybe it was all the roughhousing its gone through, but the band area is a little stretched but expected for normal wear and tear.2. $50? Got too popular and expensive for poor grad students like me.TLDR;; Buy these! I\\'m sad to see them go but I\\'m definitely getting another pair once the price drops.I got a pair for my mom and she LOVES them too!',\n",

However, one drawback is that the charging indicator light remains red throughout the entire charging process, making it challenging to visually determine when the headphones are fully charged. As a solution, I have to connect the headphones to Bluetooth on my phone to check the battery percentage. This could potentially be an issue specific to my headphones.

       "   'review': \"The JBL Tune 510BT Wireless On-Ear Headphones aim to blend the convenience of Bluetooth connectivity with JBL's signature Purebass sound. Here's a quick dive into what they offer and where they might fall short.Living up to the JBL reputation, the Tune 510BT delivers impressive sound quality for its price point. The Purebass technology ensures that bass lovers will not be disappointed, offering deep and powerful lows without overwhelming the mids and highs. However, audiophiles might find the sound profile a bit bass-heavy, affecting the balance for certain genres of music.The medium-sized, on-ear design is both a blessing and a curse. While the headphones are lightweight and relatively comfortable for short to medium listening sessions, extended use can lead to some discomfort, particularly for those not used to on-ear models.With up to 40 hours of playback time, the JBL Tune 510BT stands out in its category. This extensive battery life is ideal for commuters or those who forget to charge their devices regularly. The quick charge feature is also a nice addition, providing hours of playback with just a few minutes of charging.Bluetooth pairing is straightforward and reliable, with minimal dropouts. Multi-device connection is a useful feature, allowing you to switch between devices effortlessly. However, the absence of advanced Bluetooth codecs may affect the audio quality slightly, especially in noisy environments.The headphones sport a sleek design and come in a vibrant blue color, which will appeal to users looking for stylish options. While the build quality is decent for the price, the plastic construction may raise durability concerns over long-term use.Offering a solid combination of sound quality, battery life, and wireless convenience, the JBL Tune 510BT provides good value for those in the market for mid-range wireless headphones.The JBL Tune 510BT headphones are a respectable choice for casual listeners and bass enthusiasts looking for wireless freedom. While they excel in sound and battery life, potential buyers should consider comfort and build quality. These headphones are well-suited for everyday use, especially for those prioritizing battery life and bass performance.\",\n",

But they kept falling out, the music was lackluster with little or no bass component, and I just felt they didn’t give me the listening experience I was looking for. It’s hard to tell until you try them.  I recognize that listening tastes are personal, so I returned the buds in acknowledgement of their apparent shortcomings. Despite not being a power user I have had other, and always liked JBL products; they usually hit my listening sweet spot, regardless of the genre of music, so as a brand loyal customer I ordered a set of over-ear JBL headphones, the JBL Tune 510 BT.  I’m not sure what the model numbers mean,  but when I first put them on and listened to them I had a “wow” moment, and said “these are keepers”.  They are comfortable, they stay put on my ears when I’m working in the shop, they block out a lot of background noise, and they reveal so much more within the music than I was used to, ever knew existed, or was even hoping for.  I can’t say with certainty that the headphones hit the highest highs or  the lowest lows, but the overall presentation is complex, colorful and pleasing. They leave me wanting for nothing.  I’m entertained now with “active hearing”, as I can discern so much more depth of sound with these headphones. I fully enjoy them  such that I even wear them while preparing meals.  They would get 10 stars if they also made me a better cook.  But that’s just not gonna happen under any circumstance. At least I still have the headphones to fall back on.I don’t know if I’ll ever travel with them, but they fold kinda flat, which seems like a nice feature, although not a dealbreaker for me.  My quest started out about the quality of sound, and that’s where it ended when I purchased the JBL Tune 510BT headphones.  I’m satisfied that I can cross that quest off my to-do list.',\n",

Use daily for 1-2 hours at a time (give or take) strictly listening to music. Took a little over a couple months use before needing recharge.Easy to connect to your Bluetooth devices.

       "  'review': \"The JBL Tune 510BT Wireless On-Ear Headphones aim to blend the convenience of Bluetooth connectivity with JBL's signature Purebass sound. Here's a quick dive into what they offer and where they might fall short.Living up to the JBL reputation, the Tune 510BT delivers impressive sound quality for its price point. The Purebass technology ensures that bass lovers will not be disappointed, offering deep and powerful lows without overwhelming the mids and highs. However, audiophiles might find the sound profile a bit bass-heavy, affecting the balance for certain genres of music.The medium-sized, on-ear design is both a blessing and a curse. While the headphones are lightweight and relatively comfortable for short to medium listening sessions, extended use can lead to some discomfort, particularly for those not used to on-ear models.With up to 40 hours of playback time, the JBL Tune 510BT stands out in its category. This extensive battery life is ideal for commuters or those who forget to charge their devices regularly. The quick charge feature is also a nice addition, providing hours of playback with just a few minutes of charging.Bluetooth pairing is straightforward and reliable, with minimal dropouts. Multi-device connection is a useful feature, allowing you to switch between devices effortlessly. However, the absence of advanced Bluetooth codecs may affect the audio quality slightly, especially in noisy environments.The headphones sport a sleek design and come in a vibrant blue color, which will appeal to users looking for stylish options. While the build quality is decent for the price, the plastic construction may raise durability concerns over long-term use.Offering a solid combination of sound quality, battery life, and wireless convenience, the JBL Tune 510BT provides good value for those in the market for mid-range wireless headphones.The JBL Tune 510BT headphones are a respectable choice for casual listeners and bass enthusiasts looking for wireless freedom. While they excel in sound and battery life, potential buyers should consider comfort and build quality. These headphones are well-suited for everyday use, especially for those prioritizing battery life and bass performance.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I purchased these headphones in November 2022 and am finally putting them to rest today, May 2024.I got them on sale for $25 for studying as I started my graduate program.PROS:1. Personally, I don\\'t like 100% noise-canceling headphones because I like to be aware of my surroundings and if people are trying to talk to me. But they cancel ENOUGH of background noise to keep my ADHD attention span in check. So if you want to completely ignore the world, these may not be for you. The sound quality is very loud and clear, and the volume doesn\\'t have to be turned up that much, either.2. SO DURABLE. I am surprised these lasted for as long as they did. I was waiting for them to crap out a year ago with how I was using them. I take them to the gym; sweating on the \"earmuff\" part was kind of gross, but I cleaned it with alcohol after, and it still held up great. These have also been my go-to for traveling. I\\'ve brought them on many plane rides, fallen asleep with them in weird angles, shoved them in many PACKED backpacks and suitcases, and have been dropped quite a bit. STILL WORKED AND SOUNDED BEAUTIFULLY.3. Battery life is nearly immortal. I forget to charge these because of how long they last. I used them all week to study, maybe 4-5 hours a day, 5 days a week, and would charge them every two weeks or so.4. I also use these for work calls and Zoom meetings, and they have worked better than any of my expensive Galaxy Buds or whatever Anker earbuds.CONS:1. Mishapen. I\\'m not even mad about this. Maybe I have a big head or maybe it was all the roughhousing its gone through, but the band area is a little stretched but expected for normal wear and tear.2. $50? Got too popular and expensive for poor grad students like me.TLDR;; Buy these! I\\'m sad to see them go but I\\'m definitely getting another pair once the price drops.I got a pair for my mom and she LOVES them too!',\n",

      "- I bought a set of JBL ear buds so I could work in the shop and listen to some opera as well as classic rock  with impunity.  “Keeping it to myself” took on a whole new meaning and I tried to work with that dictate, so bought the buds.  But they kept falling out, the music was lackluster with little or no bass component, and I just felt they didn’t give me the listening experience I was looking for. It’s hard to tell until you try them.  I recognize that listening tastes are personal, so I returned the buds in acknowledgement of their apparent shortcomings. Despite not being a power user I have had other, and always liked JBL products; they usually hit my listening sweet spot, regardless of the genre of music, so as a brand loyal customer I ordered a set of over-ear JBL headphones, the JBL Tune 510 BT.  I’m not sure what the model numbers mean,  but when I first put them on and listened to them I had a “wow” moment, and said “these are keepers”.  They are comfortable, they stay put on my ears when I’m working in the shop, they block out a lot of background noise, and they reveal so much more within the music than I was used to, ever knew existed, or was even hoping for.  I can’t say with certainty that the headphones hit the highest highs or  the lowest lows, but the overall presentation is complex, colorful and pleasing. They leave me wanting for nothing.  I’m entertained now with “active hearing”, as I can discern so much more depth of sound with these headphones. I fully enjoy them  such that I even wear them while preparing meals.  They would get 10 stars if they also made me a better cook.  But that’s just not gonna happen under any circumstance. At least I still have the headphones to fall back on.I don’t know if I’ll ever travel with them, but they fold kinda flat, which seems like a nice feature, although not a dealbreaker for me.  My quest started out about the quality of sound, and that’s where it ended when I purchased the JBL Tune 510BT headphones.  I’m satisfied that I can cross that quest off my to-do list.\n",

      "- The JBL Tune 510BT Wireless On-Ear Headphones aim to blend the convenience of Bluetooth connectivity with JBL's signature Purebass sound. Here's a quick dive into what they offer and where they might fall short.Living up to the JBL reputation, the Tune 510BT delivers impressive sound quality for its price point. The Purebass technology ensures that bass lovers will not be disappointed, offering deep and powerful lows without overwhelming the mids and highs. However, audiophiles might find the sound profile a bit bass-heavy, affecting the balance for certain genres of music.The medium-sized, on-ear design is both a blessing and a curse. While the headphones are lightweight and relatively comfortable for short to medium listening sessions, extended use can lead to some discomfort, particularly for those not used to on-ear models.With up to 40 hours of playback time, the JBL Tune 510BT stands out in its category. This extensive battery life is ideal for commuters or those who forget to charge their devices regularly. The quick charge feature is also a nice addition, providing hours of playback with just a few minutes of charging.Bluetooth pairing is straightforward and reliable, with minimal dropouts. Multi-device connection is a useful feature, allowing you to switch between devices effortlessly. However, the absence of advanced Bluetooth codecs may affect the audio quality slightly, especially in noisy environments.The headphones sport a sleek design and come in a vibrant blue color, which will appeal to users looking for stylish options. While the build quality is decent for the price, the plastic construction may raise durability concerns over long-term use.Offering a solid combination of sound quality, battery life, and wireless convenience, the JBL Tune 510BT provides good value for those in the market for mid-range wireless headphones.The JBL Tune 510BT headphones are a respectable choice for casual listeners and bass enthusiasts looking for wireless freedom. While they excel in sound and battery life, potential buyers should consider comfort and build quality. These headphones are well-suited for everyday use, especially for those prioritizing battery life and bass performance.\n",

      "- I purchased these headphones in November 2022 and am finally putting them to rest today, May 2024.I got them on sale for $25 for studying as I started my graduate program.PROS:1. Personally, I don't like 100% noise-canceling headphones because I like to be aware of my surroundings and if people are trying to talk to me. But they cancel ENOUGH of background noise to keep my ADHD attention span in check. So if you want to completely ignore the world, these may not be for you. The sound quality is very loud and clear, and the volume doesn't have to be turned up that much, either.2. SO DURABLE. I am surprised these lasted for as long as they did. I was waiting for them to crap out a year ago with how I was using them. I take them to the gym; sweating on the \"earmuff\" part was kind of gross, but I cleaned it with alcohol after, and it still held up great. These have also been my go-to for traveling. I've brought them on many plane rides, fallen asleep with them in weird angles, shoved them in many PACKED backpacks and suitcases, and have been dropped quite a bit. STILL WORKED AND SOUNDED BEAUTIFULLY.3. Battery life is nearly immortal. I forget to charge these because of how long they last. I used them all week to study, maybe 4-5 hours a day, 5 days a week, and would charge them every two weeks or so.4. I also use these for work calls and Zoom meetings, and they have worked better than any of my expensive Galaxy Buds or whatever Anker earbuds.CONS:1. Mishapen. I'm not even mad about this. Maybe I have a big head or maybe it was all the roughhousing its gone through, but the band area is a little stretched but expected for normal wear and tear.2. $50? Got too popular and expensive for poor grad students like me.TLDR;; Buy these! I'm sad to see them go but I'm definitely getting another pair once the price drops.I got a pair for my mom and she LOVES them too!\n",

      "- The headphones offer excellent sound quality, user-friendly operation, and some noise isolation. They come with a separate charging port for added convenience. However, one drawback is that the charging indicator light remains red throughout the entire charging process, making it challenging to visually determine when the headphones are fully charged. As a solution, I have to connect the headphones to Bluetooth on my phone to check the battery percentage. This could potentially be an issue specific to my headphones. Nevertheless, the headphones do charge fully.\n",

      "- I bought these for the noise cancellation and to listen to music when I cut grass. I’ve tried ear buds but they just don’t cancel the sound of a lawnmower.Pros;1. The sound/bass is perfect2. The noise cancellation I give it 9 out of 10 stars.3. Functions; The various functions are responsive and works well4. Price was great for the headphones5. With the noise cancellation, I didn’t have to turn the volume on my iPhone to hear my music. That’s a plus on saving my hearing.Cons;1. The ear pieces could be a little bigger. They would be more comfortable if they were slightly larger2. Why didn’t I buy these sooner :)\n",

       "   'review': 'I bought a set of JBL ear buds so I could work in the shop and listen to some opera as well as classic rock  with impunity.  “Keeping it to myself” took on a whole new meaning and I tried to work with that dictate, so bought the buds.  But they kept falling out, the music was lackluster with little or no bass component, and I just felt they didn’t give me the listening experience I was looking for. It’s hard to tell until you try them.  I recognize that listening tastes are personal, so I returned the buds in acknowledgement of their apparent shortcomings. Despite not being a power user I have had other, and always liked JBL products; they usually hit my listening sweet spot, regardless of the genre of music, so as a brand loyal customer I ordered a set of over-ear JBL headphones, the JBL Tune 510 BT.  I’m not sure what the model numbers mean,  but when I first put them on and listened to them I had a “wow” moment, and said “these are keepers”.  They are comfortable, they stay put on my ears when I’m working in the shop, they block out a lot of background noise, and they reveal so much more within the music than I was used to, ever knew existed, or was even hoping for.  I can’t say with certainty that the headphones hit the highest highs or  the lowest lows, but the overall presentation is complex, colorful and pleasing. They leave me wanting for nothing.  I’m entertained now with “active hearing”, as I can discern so much more depth of sound with these headphones. I fully enjoy them  such that I even wear them while preparing meals.  They would get 10 stars if they also made me a better cook.  But that’s just not gonna happen under any circumstance. At least I still have the headphones to fall back on.I don’t know if I’ll ever travel with them, but they fold kinda flat, which seems like a nice feature, although not a dealbreaker for me.  My quest started out about the quality of sound, and that’s where it ended when I purchased the JBL Tune 510BT headphones.  I’m satisfied that I can cross that quest off my to-do list.',\n",

       "   'review': \"The JBL Tune 510BT Wireless On-Ear Headphones aim to blend the convenience of Bluetooth connectivity with JBL's signature Purebass sound. Here's a quick dive into what they offer and where they might fall short.Living up to the JBL reputation, the Tune 510BT delivers impressive sound quality for its price point. The Purebass technology ensures that bass lovers will not be disappointed, offering deep and powerful lows without overwhelming the mids and highs. However, audiophiles might find the sound profile a bit bass-heavy, affecting the balance for certain genres of music.The medium-sized, on-ear design is both a blessing and a curse. While the headphones are lightweight and relatively comfortable for short to medium listening sessions, extended use can lead to some discomfort, particularly for those not used to on-ear models.With up to 40 hours of playback time, the JBL Tune 510BT stands out in its category. This extensive battery life is ideal for commuters or those who forget to charge their devices regularly. The quick charge feature is also a nice addition, providing hours of playback with just a few minutes of charging.Bluetooth pairing is straightforward and reliable, with minimal dropouts. Multi-device connection is a useful feature, allowing you to switch between devices effortlessly. However, the absence of advanced Bluetooth codecs may affect the audio quality slightly, especially in noisy environments.The headphones sport a sleek design and come in a vibrant blue color, which will appeal to users looking for stylish options. While the build quality is decent for the price, the plastic construction may raise durability concerns over long-term use.Offering a solid combination of sound quality, battery life, and wireless convenience, the JBL Tune 510BT provides good value for those in the market for mid-range wireless headphones.The JBL Tune 510BT headphones are a respectable choice for casual listeners and bass enthusiasts looking for wireless freedom. While they excel in sound and battery life, potential buyers should consider comfort and build quality. These headphones are well-suited for everyday use, especially for those prioritizing battery life and bass performance.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'I purchased these headphones in November 2022 and am finally putting them to rest today, May 2024.I got them on sale for $25 for studying as I started my graduate program.PROS:1. Personally, I don\\'t like 100% noise-canceling headphones because I like to be aware of my surroundings and if people are trying to talk to me. But they cancel ENOUGH of background noise to keep my ADHD attention span in check. So if you want to completely ignore the world, these may not be for you. The sound quality is very loud and clear, and the volume doesn\\'t have to be turned up that much, either.2. SO DURABLE. I am surprised these lasted for as long as they did. I was waiting for them to crap out a year ago with how I was using them. I take them to the gym; sweating on the \"earmuff\" part was kind of gross, but I cleaned it with alcohol after, and it still held up great. These have also been my go-to for traveling. I\\'ve brought them on many plane rides, fallen asleep with them in weird angles, shoved them in many PACKED backpacks and suitcases, and have been dropped quite a bit. STILL WORKED AND SOUNDED BEAUTIFULLY.3. Battery life is nearly immortal. I forget to charge these because of how long they last. I used them all week to study, maybe 4-5 hours a day, 5 days a week, and would charge them every two weeks or so.4. I also use these for work calls and Zoom meetings, and they have worked better than any of my expensive Galaxy Buds or whatever Anker earbuds.CONS:1. Mishapen. I\\'m not even mad about this. Maybe I have a big head or maybe it was all the roughhousing its gone through, but the band area is a little stretched but expected for normal wear and tear.2. $50? Got too popular and expensive for poor grad students like me.TLDR;; Buy these! I\\'m sad to see them go but I\\'m definitely getting another pair once the price drops.I got a pair for my mom and she LOVES them too!',\n",

However, one drawback is that the charging indicator light remains red throughout the entire charging process, making it challenging to visually determine when the headphones are fully charged. As a solution, I have to connect the headphones to Bluetooth on my phone to check the battery percentage. This could potentially be an issue specific to my headphones.
