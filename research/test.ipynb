       "   'review': \"I've had these earphones for a month now and I feel like they are the best noise cancelling headphones I have ever owned. My previous ones were an older model Bose and then a comparable Sennheiser.My job requires that I do inspections in various industrial facilites.My initial work is about five hours in an office, but the decibel level is still around 70dB. At that level, the Sony WH-1000XM4 remove about 95% of the ambient noise. Music, computer videos and telephone conversations are excellent. These headphones are very good at that level.I next spend up to four hours inspecting out of the equipment floor. The noise level varies from around 78dB to 82dB. Not painfully loud, but it can cause short term hearing damage in short sessions, but 5hrs/day on a regular basis can permenantly affect your hearing. To give you a reference point, you would have to shout at someone standing about 3ft away for them to understand you. So it's not jet engine loud, but it's uncomfortable and in addition to hearing damage, long term exposure can raise your blood pressure and cause other negative effects on your physical and mental health. And yet, the level at which OSHA requires hearing protection is 85dB.All this is to say that I take sound cancellation seriously, and I also take my music seriously too. These earphones are great on both fronts. I'm very comfortable at work and I can listen to my playlists and don't feel as if I have to turn up the volume to drown out the noise of the machinery. It's really pretty cool.My total shift is about ten hours, and I feel no discomfort wearing these over my ears. I'm also bald, and there is plenty of padding on the band where it contacts the top of my head. I'm very happy with these, and even though I've spent more for earphones, I've never had a better pair for my needs.The only downside is that they are not great when using them to make phone calls in a loud enviroment. I honestly didn't expect them to function great in that respect, but it would have been great if they did.The app has numerous ways to customize your experience. More than I actually use. The adaptive sound kept changing the noise cancellation as I moved, so I turned it off. The Speak to Chat feature could be handy, but I occasionally sing along with my music and it would switch off the cancellation. So I turned that feature off also.PROS:Very comfortable to wear for hours at a time.Very good sound cancellation.Love that they pause the playback when you remove the headphones.Great that just holding a hand over the right ear cup will turn off cancellation so you can have a conversation without removing your earphones.Very good music reproduction. Bass is not quite true, but if it was really pronounced, I could adjust the equalizer.The app is very good and has a lot of features, I was pleasantly surprised even though I don't need or use many of them. It's very helpful.Love the ability to stay connected to two devices at the same time. My phone and my computer work well with the earphones.Cons:Sometimes I wish they were a little more snug (maybe I have a small head?)The app is almost TOO helpful. It can take some trial and error to get everything set up as you like it.I would prefer a more tactile controls. These require that you sweep a finger over the outside of the ear cup for volume and track control. It's actually very accurate, but I would still appreciate something that I could use while wearing gloves.Overall, these are a total win, and a bargain at the price. You could probably get something just a shade better, but it would be at a significantly higher price. These are perfect for me and my situation. I would defintely buy them again.\",\n",

       "   'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Better Than XM5',\n",
       "   'review': \"**Disclaimer: I bought mine used like new through AmazonI originally purchased the Sony XM5 because they were soooo highly rated in every article I read. I returned the XM5, got the XM4 and am so much happier. I'll compare the XM4 to the XM5, Apple AirPods Max, and Bose QuietComfort 45 - just to help anyone choosing between them.**Noise Cancellation (4.5/5): the noise cancellation on the XM4 is crazy, almost comparable to the Apple AirPods Max. I gave the XM4 a 4.5 because I still think the Apple AirPods Max have the best noise cancellation, but the Sony XM4 is very close. I also like the fact that you can turn noise cancelling on/off with a button - which is a feature not available with the Bose QuietComfort 45. The noise cancellation is much better than the XM5 and less finicky. An issue with the XM5 is that the noise cancelling would just randomly turn on/off. Like if I paused a video for a little too long, the noise cancellation would just turn off Overall, I wouldn't say I it blocks out all sound, but it's close. I can hear the sound of people talking and music, but it's quieter and I can't make out the words. I definitely can't have a conversation with them on. Also, the XM4 will pick up on when you're talking to people and turn the noise cancelling off for you - but it does make a little announcement when it does that may be annoying or disruptive.**Sound Quality (4/5): the sound quality is great. Way better than the XM5, not as great as the Apple AirPods Max.  I think the Apple headphones are just a little crisper. I think it's cool that you can turn 360 sound on, but tbh I never really use it (XM5 also has this feature). The sound is clear, and I haven't experienced any malfunctions/issues with the noise. When I had the XM5, they would just randomly sound muffled (like I was underwater) and, when that wasn't happening, the sound quality was mediocre.**Comfort (5/5): the XM4s are REALLY comfy. I wear glasses with plastic frames and a lot of headphones just don't work and are really uncomfy. The Apple AirPods Max were really uncomfortable with my glasses. Obviously, an easy solution is to just wear contacts, but I hate wearing my contacts for long periods of time - especially, when I study/do work. The XM5 were also pretty comfortable, but wouldn't stay fixed when I adjusted them - they would slip and I would need to readjust them a lot. The XM4 completely cover my ear and the ear pads are soft. They don't squeeze my head the way other headphones do and they don't hurt any part of my ear. I will say that the headband part that rests on top of my head does kind of hurt my head after wearing them for almost 10 hours. Also, I have TMJ so sometimes wearing the headphones does cause my TMJ to flare up and I'll switch to earbuds. But, I think overall these are the most comfortable headphones I have tried.**Product Quality (3.5/5): let's be honest, they're plastic and they feel plastic. They don't feel like super high quality, but let me tell you that they feel way better quality than the XM5 - those felt like a barbie toy. I think the XM4 are sturdy and pretty durable. The Apple AirPods Max are also plastic, but do feel a little more high quality - but also, nothing spectacular.**Aesthetic (3.5/5): If the aesthetic is important to you, I would say they look fine. They're a little bulky, but not terrible. Not as sleek as some others, but they don't look ridiculous. If you're really against a bulky look, then they may not be a great aesthetic match for you. I was worried they would be really clunky, but after getting them and wearing them for a bit, I really don't think they look bad.**Connectivity (4/5): I only have Apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, etc.) and I think the connectivity is great with these products! When I got the XM5, they had so many connection issues. I wasn't able to connect them to my laptop, they wouldn't stay connected to my devices - it was a mess. I was really worried I would have the same issues with the XM4, but I have had no problems so far. I will say it was a little odd to have have to download the Sony Connect app and manage the headphone through that platform, but it's user friendly and it's kind of nice to have a control for them (it's almost like a remote).**Battery Life (5/5): The battery life is insane. I've had them for 8 days and have not charged them yet - they still have about 40% charge left. They will turn off automatically to save battery life if you don't use them for a certain amount of time, which I personally like.OVERALL (4.5/5): I think the XM4 are great headphones for a better price than the Apple AirPods Max. The Bose are apparently really similar, but I've never personally tried them. The XM4 is MUCH better than the XM5 in terms of quality and price. They're comfy, great noise cancellation and sound quality, and have great battery life.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Customer Service: 5/5I purchased this item on Amazon through the seller Focus Camera.The pair I received had a volume defect that effected one side of the headphones constantly making it louder. After some firmware updates and messing with EQ, it was apparent that this was a manufacturer issue. However, when I went to try to initiate the return Amazon was only giving me the option of a full refund when I wanted an exchange. I then reached out to the seller who initiated an exchange for me without any further questions asked - In fact, I was surprised to have the shipping label in their initial reply.Product: 5/5Now that I have a new functioning unit, I can say these are some of the best all-around headphones available right now.As an Apple AirPods Pro user - and like many of you - I was discouraged at the price of Apple’s first branded headphone. No matter the quality, many of us can’t justify that price.I’ve been looking for a pair of wired-headphones for gaming use, video editing use (wired-in editing is the best for sound editing precision), and of course casual music listening use.As far as features, the gesture controls have worked accurately for me and I’ve welcomed the volume control which isn’t a feature on AirPods/AirPods Pro. Their companion app with built in EQ and detailed setting is a God-send for us Apple users who want more customization options in their products. The battery is as long as advertised and it’s nice knowing you don’t have to charge them daily (with my use). Speak-to-Chat is a great idea that has some real-world use cases. Noise Cancellation is probably the best in this mid-tier range of headphones. But if listening to your surroundings is most important to you be aware that the microphones used to listen to your environment - “Ambient Sound” Mode - seem to be located near the top of each headphone can and this appears to face up, as a result the ambient mode is not as effective as Apple’s AirPods Pro’s Transparency Mode (which I’ll assume that the same quality extends to the AirPods Max). The AirPods replicate your surrounding sounds perfectly in real-life quality as if you didn’t have anything in/on your ears. So big FYI; Apple is still king in “Transparency/Ambient” modes. Lastly, they’re extremely comfortable although your ears might get a little warm from the leatherette after prolonged use.I think price is important when considering the review of anything because it determines value. I bought these on sale for $278. With the price being so close to Apple AirPods Pro at $250, I personally feel I’m getting more than my money’s worth with a travel case, 3.5mm audio cable, charging cable, and airplane audio adapter all included with the cost at a great deal. These have a retail price of $350. So, given all of the above and the sound quality, I wouldn’t be particularly enthused or feeling like I got a great deal if I paid full-price for them but the convenience and rich sound make it a good investment nonetheless and almost all owners will be happy with them. But, I hope you understand that that means if these are on sale (especially for $250) then don’t even think about it. It’s a no-brainer Purchase them right away if you see them on sale!Lastly: Sound - The sound is great and highly customizable but the headphones themselves seem to lean towards warmer tones and more bass. Don’t worry, they’re not maxed out like the early-model Beats, but I recommend each user download their companion app and try EQ for the perfect balance. As long as you are aware that these aren’t the audiophile headphones for mixing professional music or films, nor the pair of workout/gym headphones, nor even the pair with noise cancellation that will make you sound like you’re in a soundproof room - then you’ll be happy. These headphones will not excel in any of these specific features, but that’s what makes these headphones the best over-all headphones. It’s a jack-of-all trades and so far one of my favorite Sony products ever made. I hope you enjoy yours as I’ve enjoyed mine.',\n",

       "   'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Truly a Worthy Successor to the WH1000xm3!',\n",
       "   'review': \"Honestly, there was a part of me that was worried that these headphones would not be the best pair to own after the issues that I experienced with the prior generation of them: the WH1000xm3. The main issue that I had? The build quality: the plastic around the headband snapped due to a flimsy connection, resulting in me having to tape both headbands together so that the headphones don't fall apart on me. I tried several alternate brands to see if they would work, but they never came close to giving me the same level of satisfaction while wearing them as the WH1000xm3 did, even with the taped headband taken into account. So I decided that the best replacement for a Sony headphone was another Sony headphone, and I invested in the M4, which succeeded the M3 last year (as of this writing).My initial thoughts were as follows: the headphones were a definite improvement upon the originals, retaining what I liked most about the original headphones (largely the overall comfort) while also improving the headphones in other small ways (especially in regards to the special features-the M4 are way more feature-packed than the M3 were, incorporating many elements that are being found on most other headphones these days). My favorite thing that was fixed, however, was the sound quality. You see, the original sounded amazing, and honestly sounded better overall than the likes of Bose and Sennheiser, which I have tested as potential replacements for the Sony headphones. And that is despite the fact that the headphones have a relatively small 40mm driver inside, instead of a more traditional 50mm driver. However, the one minor issue I had with the M3 was that the low frequencies were heightened a bit more than I would have liked, making songs sound a bit bass-heavy even when the EQ was turned off (the only way I was able to fix this was by setting the EQ to 'bright', which isn't ideal since the EQ does degrade the battery life). With the M4, Sony improves this by tuning down the low ends, resulting in the headphones having a very flat frequency response, which in turn results in every song having a much wider sound stage than the M3 did (and almost making them sound as good as the various open-back headphones I have tried, including the Sennheiser 650, which is my personal favorite open-back headphone).In terms of the special features, I think they were implemented quite well in these headphones. The noise cancelling is exceptional, much like it was on the M3, and the transparency mode is somehow even better than it was on the prior generation headphone, sounding a lot more natural and less tinny overall. The auto activation of transparency mode during conversations is fantastic, and enables me to talk to people naturally without ever having to remove the headphones from my ear. This also means that I don't have to awkwardly tap my hand on the earcup with the M4, either. The DSEE Extreme audio enhancer really helps to make music sound a lot more full, even when using devices that don't support the LDAC wireless standard. It isn't as good as listening to lossless files wired, mind you, but it is still an amazing feature that helps to take advantage of the flat sound stage and frequency response of the headphone drivers.Now, this isn't to say that these headphones don't have issues, mind you. The auto-pause when removing the headphones from your ears is very much a gimmick, and doesn't always pause the song (and may even resume the music before you have a chance to place the headphones back on your ear). Since the headphones use a light sensor to tell if you are wearing your headphones or not, it means even a simple shadow can cause the headphones to think that they are back on your ears and restart music playback. It is quite obnoxious, and it is best left out. Another, more minor issue is the touch controls. While I personally have no issue with them, I know that there are many people that don't like them whatsoever. So I will just make a note that they are still here, and they work in much the same way as they did on the M3. Finally, I should mention that the flat soundstage, while amazing for my listening experience, may not be for everyone. Bassheads in particular would likely prefer extra pronunciation on the lower ranges. And while they will never be quite as bass-heavy as the Skullcandy or Beats line, the EQ can still bring the bass levels up quite a bit, using a 'clear bass' slider that reminds me of the slider on the Skullcandy Skullcrushers: raising the bass without causing distortion.Overall, the headphones turned out to be quite an exceptional pair, especially when it comes to listening to music during commutes. The great noise cancelling, beautiful audio, and fantastic transparency mode definitely make these headphones a winner in my book. And the app only helps to improve the flexibility of the headphones, allowing for many different features to be unlocked. And while these headphones certainly have some issues (no pair of headphones are perfect, after all), I think the benefits more than outweigh the issues for me, and put these at the top of my list of best closed-back headphones that I have worn. Hopefully Sony will continue to make amazing headphones like these in the ears to come.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"I can't compare these to other sets in their class, what I can say is that they are so good, I don't even need to consider trying a different set. I use them at my desk for work as well as while traveling.For work, they are very, very comfortable and don't cause soreness or headaches like other headphones I have used in the past. I have gone thru multi day planning sessions where I was in meetings almost the entire day and they were excellent. I also love how I don't have to charge them when using the wire to connect them to my work laptop. Noise canceling doesn't work, but the fact that they are over the ear headphones as it is, I can't easily hear background noise from my home office.I recently took them on my first trip. The battery life was great, didn't need to recharge them the entire trip. The noise cancelling technology was absolutely fantastic, even if I didn't have any media playing they were solid. At times, I forgot I was even on a plane. The case for them is very good, holds them nicely and was sturdy enough to hold up while in my bag.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'UPDATE #2: After returning the first set of these headphones, I ordered another set on Prime Day and have now had a little more than a month to try them out.  Based on this experience so far, I\\'m raising the rating from 2 to 4 stars.  Trying not to jinx things, but the new unit does not have the right earcup static issue that plagued the first set (and that a not insignificant number of users have complained about).  I\\'m not sure whether one of the firmware updates addressed the issue or whether the first set had a hardware issue of some sort, but the new set has not had the issue.I now believe the \"bluetooth stopping for no reason\" issue noted in my prior update is not a defect, but the speak to chat feature, which stops the playback whenever it detects a human voice. I understand the point of this feature, but Sony should calibrate it better.  As it is, even when set on low sensitivity and not to focus on voice, it still stops playback at even low human voice volumes.  As a practical matter, this means you can\\'t sing or hum along to songs without having the playback constantly cut off.  I\\'ve wound up disabling this feature.Other than that, the new headphones have been great -- super noise cancelling and music quality, decent phone call quality (maybe not best in class but more than serviceable), and day-in, day-out comfortable.  The only reason I didn\\'t rate them at 5 stars is that this set, like the previous one, has a very high default volume, such that sometimes when you turn the headphones on, the music will start blasting out at an uncomfortably high volume. (I think that if you use another set of headphones, as I sometimes do, the XM4 will forget its last volume setting.)UPDATED:  I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy.  Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all).  At other times, there are skips or pops.  While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I\\'m still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I\\'m now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.PROS:1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose.  They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you\\'re not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file.  When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world.  I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing.  A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it\\'s still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have.  It\\'s no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a \"feature\" of ANC headphones.2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used.  The ear pieces in particular are outstanding.  I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable.  However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable.  These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on.  I can comfortably wear these for hours.3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well.  I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.CONS:1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either).  The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music.  Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue.  I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone\\'s bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file.  I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn\\'t allow users to change it.  It\\'s really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason.  For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.2) Phone call quality -- meh.  Some calls are good, others not so much.  Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality.  However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc.  Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better.  I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that\\'s the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on.  However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.).  It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones.  However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have.  I\\'m likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.',\n",

       "   'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    My review is effectively these should be xm 3.1 not 4 build but good otherwise.',\n",
       "   'review': \"about the same as the xm3. the pairing aspect is nice and was my reason to upgrade. I couldn't take all the paring issues anymore, and having more control in my phone to move between all my computers was appreciated.The app does only pair to 2 devices, but it keeps a memory or  list of the devices you have paired to (it is not easy to find this information online). I should probably make some youtube video.  Having this management aspect makes these so much more usable. They should back-port this to xm3 as well even if only one device at a time software control is so helpful. I''m in software and have to switch computers and phones a lot.Otherwise, i the anc is superior to xm3, mildly so. For me the reason to upgrade is if you want excellent multiparing. Frankly it seems to just work better. Even single paring for me was always dicey on the xm3 there are some devices it just wouldn't pair with. Not the case with these. The sound and anc aren't really reasons to upgrade. they all sound fantastic.The lacking issue is still build quality. they look nice, but the qc 25/35 which i also own use metal in the hinges and i am certain will last longer from a build standpoint. I 've pretty much taken the xm3 apart, they are all plastic, and you better be careful.  That said these are so easy to work on. I have opened up my xm3's replaced the battery and pads and they are still going strong at almost 3 years now. I upgraded because i literally use these every day, i actually sleep in them and the multiparing was wearing on me. Given how much they are used it was worth it for me.As long as these sony continue to make great anc headphones, and keep them serviceable i'll continue to go sony. The tipping point is the sound vs bose. Don't get me wrong bose gets a really bad rep in my opinion. They are not bad in any way and still have better build quality and calls. sure they are a bluetooth headphone. I have high end stuff too they don't have that kind of detail. But you know what. These are the headphones i used. I don't especially like being tethered to a computer. Anyway with bose the sound just isn't as fun. For me when you using headpones with small speakers, you to tune warm unlike large receiver speakers. I could even say if your a bit older  losing your ability to detect highs maybe then bose makes sense, or your tastes are more for a flat neutral. the sound bose is good. However that's isn't me at all if i want that i'll have a chat with my wife. I don't want boomy but i do want a warm sound that's exciting. these are the best sounding bluetooth headphones with ANC i 've heard and they are plenty good enough for me. I will pretty much continue to live in my xm4 now at my desk and when i am out use my xm3s.  By the way i picked these on verizon for some insane deal. They were like 250 already. I'd wait for black friday. i was going to, but then that came up. 350's a lot for this build quality, but if you haven't used these and are on the fence amazon is good because of the return policy if you don't like them. I really do think this is one of those rare great products, and i have had so much use out of my xm3. the pause /turn off when take off is also wonderful. I had that on my plantronics and am glad they added that here. The speak to chat feature is also nice. I like the low sensitivity mode.I have ultimately decided good anc is so worth it. I have way lower stress. Just the other day i was working at home, and there is all this construction going on i didn't even notice it, and i could see how stressed out my wife was. I also have kids and dogs, I put these things on and I am like a bachelor. I use them everywhere card, yard worksconcentration, sleep. It's just fantastic technology. Even if your working out and you are on some loud exercise equipment you can use these and save your ears and hear the tv. They aren't waterproof, but i just put  on a fan when i am working out to prevent sweating and that works great.  I am also glad they aren't water proof so i can easily replace the battery for 15 dollars. It has a freaking plug and doesn't even need to be soldered. xm4 is the same. Get these. :)\",\n",

       "   'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    SONY WH-1000XM4... BEST HEADPHONES EVER',\n",
       "   'review': \"I am coming from a set of Bose QC15 and Sony MDR-7506 and wow!! Hats off to Sony for their MKIV headphones.Sony WH-1000XM4 has incredible sound and features!The active noice cancelling works GREAT!!! I put my head next to the wall AC unit and can barely hear a thing.Compared to my QC15, the Sony is so much better at ANC you'd think the Bose were turned off. Don't get me wrong, I've loved my QC15 on a daily basis for over ten years but comparing these are like night and day.Music from Sony WH-1000XM4 sounds rich and full in a way that I've only heard at a movie theatre and the Bose QC15 and MDR-7506 are no schlubs; I'm used to decent headphones. The custom EQ that you can set and upload to the Sony WH-1000XM4 using their proprietary app is everything. Very intuitive and easy to use and you don't even NEED the app if you just want to use them out of the box and not futz with settings, it can pair like any normal bluetooth device by holding down the power button; however, the app does everything automatically.Compared to AirPods Pro, the ability to tune every feature versus just on/off makes me feel like I have a quality high-end device versus a kind of generic one. Not to get off topic, but I returned the AirPods Pro; they are nice but not for the money. I felt that AirPods Pro FUNCTIONED very very well (Good ANC, brilliant pairing, can use either left, or right, or both, and the auto on/off/pause/play works like a charm) but I thought that they missed the mark on sound quality, comfort, and battery life just enough that I didn't feel that they were worth $200+.Spoiler Alert, I went with Bose QC Earbuds but that's another story.Getting back on topic...The Sony WH-1000XM4 are worth every cent. I scored mine on Prime Day and got a great deal on them!!They're worth MSRP... but try for less. I got them for $75 off MSRP Oct 14, 2020 and they did free next day delivery.There's my obligatory plug, where's my gift card?Oh, right. It was in the box with my headphones, duh. lol. (they gave me a gift card for Prime Day)The thing that surprised me the MOST about the Sony WH-1000XM4 are how well they perform as a headset. Whatever gadgetry they've packed in these is pretty magical. When on a phone call or FaceTime, the headset WHILE KEEPING ANC ACTIVE, makes it so I can hear myself speak and therefore am not shouting while on the phone like I typically am. WHILE ANC IS STILL WORKING. Magical.The auto I/O/Play/Pause feature when you remove them from your head is very nice too.Very happy about multipoint bluetooth. I have it set to work with my iPhone and Sony X950H TV and it's seamless.I was actually waiting for them to upgrade to having this and is why I didn't go for the MKIII. Glad I waited.The case is nice and holds all of the accessories plus a few more tiny ones that I had for other travel things. The case fits perfectly in my laptop bag (Brenthaven Elliot Deluxe) and does not make it any bulkier or bulgy. The case is actually smaller than the one for my QC15 because the Sony WH-1000XM4 fold up! Bonus!!USB-C charging instead of Micro-USB is superb, I am very much enjoying the rapid charge feature and since I plan on having these for a long time, the port is a sturdy one that will take many many many plugging/unpluggings.Battery life seems to function as advertised, although I haven't timed it for 30 hours, I just charge it at the end of the night. If I forget to, no worries, it's charged enough for the day by the time I am done getting ready to go.All in all, very happy with the Sony WH-1000XM4. Five stars!\",\n",

       "   'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Excellent noise cancelling, bluetooth range, sound very good, comfortable, horrible user controls',\n",
       "   'review': 'A disclaimer: I received this product as part of Amazon’s Vine program.  While I didn’t pay for the item, the review is totally my personal, unbiased review.  Neither Amazon, nor the vendor has influenced this review in any way.ProsExcellent noise cancellingVery good sound quality for all Bluetooth profiles (Listening to music, phone/video calls)Battery lifeExcellent Bluetooth rangeAutomatic voice detection to pause music and enter transparency modeConsTouch controls are simply awful!Dual Bluetooth device supportConstant beeps and noise cancelling turned off especially with “Detection of Actions” enabledVoice detection for stopping music and going into a transparency mode responds to almost any sound you make.  A large breath, grunt, anything will trigger this feature.Rubs on the “helix” outer part of the ear on the left earSomewhat complex set up processOverall these are really excellent Bluetooth headphones.  The noise cancellation is absolutely excellent.  This is probably the best noise-cancelling headphone available.  The Bluetooth range is also exceptional.  Audio quality for music is also very good, and I expect most people will find them to be excellent. Phone/video call audio is also good receiving, and acceptable for the microphone.  They have long battery life and charge quickly.  They are relatively comfortable as well. The touch user controls are simply dreadful.  There are many other features with a range of benefit.Comfort:They seem comfortable, and the ear pads are soft and plush.  However after several hours the outside of my ears start to hurt from rubbing on the insides of the headphones (the area called helix on top of the ear rubs on the inside of the left ear around optical sensor area.)  If at sometime we resume taking long international flights this could be an even larger issue.They are still comfortable though when wearing them with glasses.  They ear pads are pliant enough to continue to make a good seal without painfully pushing them into your head.Bluetooth, Pairing, Multiple devices:These support 2 Bluetooth devices to be connected simultaneously.  The Bose QC35 has had this feature for some time.  I initially paired my iPhone X with the headphones.  I then added a MacBook Pro from within the Connect app.  I was then able to play music from the MacBook.  I went back to the iPhone and tried to play something.  It didn’t immediately play. In fact, it is rather finicky.  Sometimes starting something with audio on the iPhone will cause audio to switch.  Mostly it doesn’t if something is playing already on one device.  Stopping the audio, waiting, and then starting the audio on the phone is a bit more reliable. Even if the source on one device is paused and not playing it may not switch back.This is a bit problematic though since the iPhone still thinks it is connected to a Bluetooth headphone, so the audio is still routed to the Sony WH-1000MX4, but isn’t played – so it goes no where.  This works far more seamlessly on the Bose QC35.  I actually found myself disabling this feature half the time.While the WH-1000MX4 does have voice announcements, it doesn’t speak the name of the device.  It will say “Bluetooth device 1 connected,” whereas the Bose QC35 will speak “Joe’s iPhone.” Even more confusing is that device 1 and device 2 doesn’t always refer to the same device.  Sometimes my iPhone is device 1 and other times it is device 2.  The only way to really know is to go into the app where it will identify the device associated with device 1 and device 2.I added a 3rd Bluetooth device, again from the app.  This works, but will disconnect one of the 2 already connected devices.  It works pretty much like most Bluetooth devices.  You disconnect at least one of the currently connected devices and then connect the new device.  You can have multiple devices paired, but a maximum of 2 devices currently connected.  You can see the list of devices within the Connect app.Bluetooth range is excellent.  It would easily stay connected when going from one area of a reasonably large house to another.  The range exceeds any other Bluetooth headphones.Sound Quality:Sound quality has to be the most subjective area to evaluate, yet one of the most important. Most people will find these really very good to excellent.  For most these may well be the best sounding headphones they have ever had. Those more critical may find a few areas where they lack, but still they are excellent for noise cancelling headphones.  Sound quality is probably one of the best aspects of these headphones.The sound quality when listening to high quality content was very enjoyable.  Overall they are fairly well balanced, albeit a bit heavy on the low end, but not boomy or with obvious peaks in the response.  More so they sound “warm.” The bass is noticeable, and quite deep.  You will clearly hear the thump of a drum, but still somewhat tight.  The deep bass on some of the Billie Eilish tracks is impressive. The bass is not so excessive though that it drowns out mid or high frequencies.  Music sounds good with individual instruments clearly identified.  Male and female vocals sound good and natural.The deep warm bass works well for movies and similar entertainment.  These will likely work quite well for watching airplane entertainment.  High frequencies are clear, and more smooth than harsh. They are balanced overall with a bit more low frequency emphasis that shifts the balance a bit.The iPhone app does have equalization settings, so it is possible to adjust to your personal preferences.  I reviewed these set at flat, default setting.If one is going to compare these to audiophile headphones they will clearly notice differences. They will not replace examples of the best open or closed back audiophile headphones.  They simply lack the detail, imaging and placement that those headphones present when paired with a quality DAC and headphone amplifier.  That really isn’t a fair comparison though as these are noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones and they do a great job at that.I did listen through both Bluetooth with the AAC codec and wired with a quality external DAC while listening to high resolution content streamed from Tidal through a Master Quality Authenticated DAC. They do sound better with the same content played through a wired DAC than Bluetooth.  The difference wasn’t as much was expected. Sony did a good job with Bluetooth.  I also tried listening to them with the power off, as plain wired headphones.  They didn’t sound that different, which is rather a good thing.  The same experiment with Bose QC35s will have a totally different sound.  Bose relies extensively on equalization to get their otherwise somewhat poor sounding headphones to sound good.  Sony starts out with decent sounding drivers.I have not tried using the LDAC hi-resolution Bluetooth codec yet.  This isn’t as easy as it would seem to use on either iOS or MacOS.  You can’t simply use a high-resolution source to use it.  You need to download and install the Sony Music Center app, then load the high-resolution content into that app to play.  I’m not sure how to get it to work with a Mac at all. The better codec should sound better.  To be fair, at least part of the problem is Apple in this case.I did try the DSEE Extreme feature.  This supposedly improves the sound quality of low bit rate compressed content.  I listened to some low bit rate MP3 files, and some standard streaming services, such as Amazon Prime music.  It sounded different, I’m not sure I would say it sounded better.  At least what I noticed was a boost in high frequencies.  It made some of the squashed high frequency details more noticeable, but they still sounded highly compressed, and to some extent the compression artifacts became more noticeable.  This may well be a personal choice, and likely varies over content, level of compression, and codecs used.  The bottom line is that you really need to start with quality content.The 360 Reality Audio was a disappointment. I tried playing a variety of tracks in 360 Reality Audio on Tidal.  I did this using the Tidal app on both iPhone and a Mac. I did link the Tidal app with the Sony app as part of the initial setup.  I did notice a wider sound stage. It wasn’t like demos in a movie theater for Dolby Atmos or anything that dramatic.  There was some front/rear placement depth.  It was interesting to play with for a while.  What I found though is that it just sounded strange.  I played some of the same tracks on Tidal HiFi or MQA and to me they sounded much better, much more musical.  Call me a purist, audiophile, or whatever, but I found the highly processed audio more annoying than enjoyable.  It doesn’t replace the stereo imaging or placement that superb headphones can present as described above.  Honestly overall these sound good enough without these audio tricks.  Perhaps if there were some movie encoded with 360 Audio it would be better to enjoy special effects and less about musicality. It seems more of a gimmick than musical.  By far the best quality was the same song in Master Quality on Tidal with an external DAC and the 3.5mm wired cable.Phone callsThe audio quality on phone and video calls has been excellent on the receiving side and is about as good as Bluetooth HFP profile gets. it is excellent for conversations.  With the excellent noise cancellation these are excellent for long video calls.  They will likely continue to be great for those forced to endure a noisy open office environment, or need to make phone calls in a noisy area such as an airport or train station.Phone call microphone:Overall I’ve had only a few complaints from those that I’ve in meetings or on calls with.  Most people said I sounded fine.  I was on one phone call with my iPhone and the person had difficulty understanding me and could hear me fine when I switched to the iPhone.  They said I sounded “far away.”  On a video call I had some people refer to the sound as “bubbly.” After switching to AirPod Pros and the sound improved.They seem to isolate ambient noise reasonably well, although I haven’t had extreme cases to try during working from home due to COVID-19.  This is one area where Bose QC35 were awful. I don’t know if they match AirPod Pro for microphone beam forming, but so far they seem fine. These work for phone and video calls, but aren’t great.Noise cancellationThese are fantastic at noise cancellation.  I haven’t been on an airplane with them, the real test, but these seem significantly better than the already excellent Bose QC35.  At least around the house they block out the low frequency sounds that noise-cancelling headphones are best at. Around the house even a Ninja blender was mostly attenuated while I was on a conference call.  My neighbor’s air conditioner that still can be heard with the Bose QC35 and AirPod Pros is completely gone with these.  I was even using a really loud flooring saw and used these.  I did still hear the saw, but not very loud, and I could still enjoy music while sawing flooring!  Family talking is mostly gone during conference calls and entirely when playing music.  I expect that these would be great in an open office environment or an airplane.  Bose QC35 were the best I had used prior to these, and the Bose don’t work nearly as well, especially for voice.  They have much better noise cancellation than Apple Air Pod Pro buds too. If your main reason for looking for headphones is noise cancellation, these are what you buy.One annoyance I had with the Bose QC35 headphones is if I wore glasses the sidepieces would create an acoustic leak and let some noise in. They still work, but especially on an airplane you would hear more air noise. I haven’t tried them on an airplane yet due to covid, but so far I don’t notice nearly as much difference as I did with the Bose with glasses.Battery:Sony claims 20 hours of battery life without defining what mode. Other headphones sometimes have decreased battery life with HFP (phone calls).  These definitely exceed the rated battery life.  With the first charge they lasted almost a week of varied use.  I used them for a multi-day virtual conference, and other meetings (combination of HFP and A2DP) for over 14 hours, and they still had 60% charge.  Sony doesn’t specify any longer battery life with the wired cable.  On the Bose I would plug the cable in when I would go to sleep on international flights, and Bose quoted 40 hours like that, so 20 hours isn’t fantastic.  It is more than enough though.  It will get you through the longest flight plus some other use.  Almost any other use it should be more than enough.  I used them over 10 hours straight one day and they were still around 70% charged.Charging:These charge with a USB-C connector.  They come with a very short (about 6”) USB-A to C cable but no power supply.  They charge relatively quickly (less than an hour from 20%, but I didn’t time it).  You will need around a 10W power supply to get the fastest charging.  I monitored the charge current from 20% capacity.  They started at 0.44A or roughly 2.2W, which seemed reasonable for headphones. Then they jumped to 1.32A or about 6.66W, then to the maximum I saw was 1.8A or about 9 W! It is surprising that Sony pushed that much power into a headphone! The actually battery capacity has to be pretty large, so it apparently does use quite a bit of power.  In most cases this is of no issue, they charge up quick.  It can be an issue is if you are stuck trying to charge them in an airport or airplane port. They will also suck a lot out of a battery pack.User interface:This is the worst aspect of these headphones.  The touch controls are simply dreadful, almost unusable.  Simple buttons would have been much better.  Even with practice it is almost impossible to master the gestures to go forward, backward, start/stop, and change the volume. Either it doesn’t register the touch, or it does the wrong thing.  You try and turn the volume down and track changes.  To be fair, they do have a volume control.  The Air Pods Pro don’t and that is really annoying. Even with practice controls don’t work right.Some guidance: to change the volume, especially lower it, swipe down on the right ear as if you are petting it. Just swiping as if using a smartphone touch screen won’t work right.  Swipe down from above the top just like petting it, and then it might change the volume.  Changing tracks is even harder, and only seems to happen when trying to change the volume.  Hitting the start stop button doesn’t seem to work, except of course when you try to adjust the headphone on your head and then it stops what you were listening to, and would likely hang up a call – be careful of that.  I end up using controls on my phone or computer most times.  Simple buttons would have been SO much better.Voice assistant:Setting up Alexa is not all that easy. Assuming the headphones are already set for Alexa, you already have the Alexa app installed and set up, and the headphones are already paired to the phone you still need to add the WH1000MX4 to Alexa. This takes going to the Alexa app, and adding the device.  It will then want to pair with Bluetooth.  I put the WH1000MX4 into pairing mode by using the almost hidden mode of holding the power button (rather than the app). It then showed it failed to connect, but it actually seemed to pair on the second attempt.  If you were successful you will have a second pairing of the device as LE_-WH1000XM4, for a second Bluetooth Low Energy pairing.Then Alexa did work hands free (if enabled in the Alexa app).  You could just say Alexa and it worked.  You could ask Alexa what ever you normally would.  It seemed to actually work better than the Echo Auto that also relies on the app.  The response audio always has the first syllable of cut off though.  This works fine for querying Alexa, or invoking Alexa content.  It does NOT work for controlling other functions on the phone, even changing the volume.  Telling Alexa to play won’t resume what was playing on the phone, it will resume what the Alexa app used last it seems.  This may be iPhone limitations, but I will likely switch to Siri and see if that works better.  It would be great if you could have all of them and just invoke the desired one with the appropriate wake word (Alexa, Hey Siri, OK Google).  I haven’t tried other voice assistants with these yet.The automatic speak to chat feature is both great and annoying.  At least with the sensitivity set to automatic it will detect voice quite well and stop the content you may be listening to, and allow ambient sound to be heard.  This, when desired is far more convenient than Air Pods Pro where you have to hold be button for a few seconds to go into transparency mode.  While you still can’t hear what someone says to you, at least when you reply to them, it immediately lets you hear them, and doesn’t take the seconds the Air Pods do. With AirPods you also need 2 actions to stop music and enter transparency mode.  This mostly works.  In the automatic mode it doesn’t need to actually be voice that triggers it.  Anything like a grunt, large breath, anything it seems will trigger it. The slightest grunt or sound and they stopped the music and went into ambient mode.  There is a low sensitivity mode that I haven’t tried yet.  You will find this feature to be a love/hate relationship after a while.  Even with the “Focus on Voice” feature enabled this still seems to be overly sensitive.Another feature is adaptive sound control.  This is supposed to optimize the sound based on location, and detection of actions.  This is likely useful when changing between an office, train station, etc.  I haven’t evaluated that during a pandemic.As for automatic detection of actions, that can be very annoying.  It was fine when sitting in one place. Initially I didn’t know why EVERY time I bent down the headphones would beep and go out of noise cancelling mode. Then resume playing normally. This is apparently the notification for detection of actions.  This can be disabled in the app.  If someone were to use these headphones in a gym or exercising this would be annoying as well.  (Note: These are NOT sport headphones!) AppThe app is essential to setting up, using, adjusting, and updating the headphones.  Sony even uses the app for pairing with the iPhone, which is unusual.  The app allows configuring the many options available, equalization and more.  You also use the app to optimize the headphones for the shape of your ears by taking a picture of your head and both ears.  I went through the whole process.There are a lot of options in the app, and the layout is OK.  It can be a bit confusing.The app does provide a lot of control and information.  It shows battery level, and the current codec in use.  This last part I really like, Apple typically doesn’t show these details.  Many options can beyond simply being enabled or disabled from the app can also be further controlled.Case, accessoriesA nice rigid fabric coated and lined travel case is provided. It is similar in size to the Bose QC35.  It appears that it would protect the headphones and hold up well with travel.A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable is included. This allows using the headphones with a wired source, such as an airplane entertainment system.  The cable does not have a microphone or controls and will not control and iPhone, iPad, or Mac or support calling.  It is only a 3-conductor plug for stereo listening.While the Bose QC35 headphones come with an equivalent cable, the Bose QC25 cable, or the Amazon Basics alternative cable can be purchased that does allow using the QC35 for phone calls, and wired remote.Also included is a short USB-A to USB-C charge cable, no charger, and the old 2-pin airplane adapter.',\n",

       "   'review': 'I spent more on these headphones than I ever have on a pair of headphones before, so I was hoping that on top of the normal duties of a pair of headphones, that they would also wash my dishes and walk my dog for me ect. To be fair, they are probably the best headphones I\\'ve ever owned (which they should be as they\\'re like double the price of the last \\'expensive\\' pair I bought), but they didn\\'t really wow me either.The noise cancelling and sound quality is generally fine. I\\'m a bassist, so if the bass is emphasized, I\\'m happy. I don\\'t really notice the bass to be particularly heavy. I can usually distinctly hear bass lines if I make a conscious effot, but they don\\'t tend to overpower (which I prefer, but I know a lot of people don\\'t). I haven\\'t messed around with the equalizer much so I can\\'t speak to that. My issue with the sound quality is in the ambient sound mode. The ambient sound mode makes the ambient sounds sound horrible. This is largely my first experience with noise cancelling, so I don\\'t have anything to compare it to, maybe we just don\\'t have the tech yet to amplify sounds and not make them sound tinney and horrible. But yeah, it legit sounds like I\\'m listening to the world through a tin can. As a result I rarely use the ambient sound mode (this mode has noise cancelling but allows for some noises to come through) and rather just use the noise cancelling mode when I want to be aware of my surroundings.These headphones have several annoying features that if I knew I\\'d dislike so much I would\\'ve gone for another pair of headphones. First, the touch controls. Apparently there are some people out there who like the touch controls, but are they really necessary when buttons exist? Touch controls only make sense when there is a screen you can look at or at least some sort of tactile cue that reassures you that you\\'re doing the thing you want to be doing. The two most important functions (on/off, and sound cancelling level) are controlled by real buttons, but pause, skip, and volume are all controlled by touch controls on the outside surface of the right headphone. Unless you are sitting perfectly still these are pretty much impossible to use and can result in unwanted pauses and skips. The #1 time I wear these is when I walk/run my dog. I cannot use the touch controls when I\\'m running and can occasionally use them while I\\'m walking, but they tend to be very imprecise. So to turn up the volume I have to do the motion like 3 times until I accidentally skip the song instead. This isn\\'t a rare problem where most of the time I can use them fine. This happens the vast majority of times I try to use the touch controls when I\\'m moving - I\\'m actually pleasantly surprised if I can do the correct gesture while walking. Some people may argue that I have failed to learn how to use the touch controls (I\\'ve had these headphones for 6+ months), but there really shouldn\\'t be a learning curve for being able to pause music - this is a design failure.I also wear these to the gym quite often. The other problem that I have with the touch controls is that I cannot do any sort of exercise with my arms overhead (pull ups, overhead press, ect.) with these on because my shoulder will touch the outside surface and pause or skip. I usually end up taking them off for my set.So, if you\\'re the least bit hesitant about the touch controls, I\\'d say check out your other options because if I knew they\\'d be this frustrating I would\\'ve bought different headphones.The second overall problem I have with these headphones is how much talking they do. So you\\'d think, turn them on and play music, right? No, its turn them on, it says \"Power on\". Then it tells you \"Bluetooth connected\" - cool, good to know I can now turn on my music and listen... Unless I have a second device nearby and it says \"Bluetooth second device connected\". Then (because I\\'m walking my dog away from my second device) it plays a sound to tell me that device has been disconnected. Then I change the noise cancelling level... \"Ambient sound\" which sounds bad so I press the button again... \"Ambient Sound control off\". The robot talks so damn slow, it\\'s literally like a minute of messing around before I can just listen to my music. Y\\'all really couldn\\'t abbreviate any of this or make it talk faster? And if I want to change the noise cancelling level while listening to music or a podcast I best pause the song otherwise I\\'ll miss half of it listening to the robot tell me what I know I\\'m doing and can hear the difference between. This is all a bit of an exaggeration, but it\\'s enough to frustrate me. For a $300 pair of headphones I think I have the right to be impatient.Another minor thing that might not actually be the fault of the headphones is they have trouble with certain apps. Sometimes I\\'ll press play on my phone but it won\\'t play through the headphones for like 10 seconds or sometimes more (which is enough time to make me think something is wrong). Again, the headphones could be innocent here - they tend to work fine with the Apple Music app, but not the Apple Podcast app. I\\'m leaning towards blaming the app.Also the headphones generally comfy to wear. I have a small head, and they can fall off if I\\'m laying down but its not a huge issue.Overall, these are good headphones, but they have some design choices that make the headphones annoying to use which is frustrating for the price. If these break I won\\'t buy another pair and would likely look for ones that don\\'t have touch control, but I didn\\'t think these issues were enough of a problem to get a refund or anything.',\n",

      "I've had these earphones for a month now and I feel like they are the best noise cancelling headphones I have ever owned. My previous ones were an older model Bose and then a comparable Sennheiser.My job requires that I do inspections in various industrial facilites.My initial work is about five hours in an office, but the decibel level is still around 70dB. At that level, the Sony WH-1000XM4 remove about 95% of the ambient noise. Music, computer videos and telephone conversations are excellent. These headphones are very good at that level.I next spend up to four hours inspecting out of the equipment floor. The noise level varies from around 78dB to 82dB. Not painfully loud, but it can cause short term hearing damage in short sessions, but 5hrs/day on a regular basis can permenantly affect your hearing. To give you a reference point, you would have to shout at someone standing about 3ft away for them to understand you. So it's not jet engine loud, but it's uncomfortable and in addition to hearing damage, long term exposure can raise your blood pressure and cause other negative effects on your physical and mental health. And yet, the level at which OSHA requires hearing protection is 85dB.All this is to say that I take sound cancellation seriously, and I also take my music seriously too. These earphones are great on both fronts. I'm very comfortable at work and I can listen to my playlists and don't feel as if I have to turn up the volume to drown out the noise of the machinery. It's really pretty cool.My total shift is about ten hours, and I feel no discomfort wearing these over my ears. I'm also bald, and there is plenty of padding on the band where it contacts the top of my head. I'm very happy with these, and even though I've spent more for earphones, I've never had a better pair for my needs.The only downside is that they are not great when using them to make phone calls in a loud enviroment. I honestly didn't expect them to function great in that respect, but it would have been great if they did.The app has numerous ways to customize your experience. More than I actually use. The adaptive sound kept changing the noise cancellation as I moved, so I turned it off. The Speak to Chat feature could be handy, but I occasionally sing along with my music and it would switch off the cancellation. So I turned that feature off also.PROS:Very comfortable to wear for hours at a time.Very good sound cancellation.Love that they pause the playback when you remove the headphones.Great that just holding a hand over the right ear cup will turn off cancellation so you can have a conversation without removing your earphones.Very good music reproduction. Bass is not quite true, but if it was really pronounced, I could adjust the equalizer.The app is very good and has a lot of features, I was pleasantly surprised even though I don't need or use many of them. It's very helpful.Love the ability to stay connected to two devices at the same time. My phone and my computer work well with the earphones.Cons:Sometimes I wish they were a little more snug (maybe I have a small head?)The app is almost TOO helpful. It can take some trial and error to get everything set up as you like it.I would prefer a more tactile controls. These require that you sweep a finger over the outside of the ear cup for volume and track control. It's actually very accurate, but I would still appreciate something that I could use while wearing gloves.Overall, these are a total win, and a bargain at the price. You could probably get something just a shade better, but it would be at a significantly higher price. These are perfect for me and my situation. I would defintely buy them again.\n",
      "**Disclaimer: I bought mine used like new through AmazonI originally purchased the Sony XM5 because they were soooo highly rated in every article I read. I returned the XM5, got the XM4 and am so much happier. I'll compare the XM4 to the XM5, Apple AirPods Max, and Bose QuietComfort 45 - just to help anyone choosing between them.**Noise Cancellation (4.5/5): the noise cancellation on the XM4 is crazy, almost comparable to the Apple AirPods Max. I gave the XM4 a 4.5 because I still think the Apple AirPods Max have the best noise cancellation, but the Sony XM4 is very close. I also like the fact that you can turn noise cancelling on/off with a button - which is a feature not available with the Bose QuietComfort 45. The noise cancellation is much better than the XM5 and less finicky. An issue with the XM5 is that the noise cancelling would just randomly turn on/off. Like if I paused a video for a little too long, the noise cancellation would just turn off Overall, I wouldn't say I it blocks out all sound, but it's close. I can hear the sound of people talking and music, but it's quieter and I can't make out the words. I definitely can't have a conversation with them on. Also, the XM4 will pick up on when you're talking to people and turn the noise cancelling off for you - but it does make a little announcement when it does that may be annoying or disruptive.**Sound Quality (4/5): the sound quality is great. Way better than the XM5, not as great as the Apple AirPods Max.  I think the Apple headphones are just a little crisper. I think it's cool that you can turn 360 sound on, but tbh I never really use it (XM5 also has this feature). The sound is clear, and I haven't experienced any malfunctions/issues with the noise. When I had the XM5, they would just randomly sound muffled (like I was underwater) and, when that wasn't happening, the sound quality was mediocre.**Comfort (5/5): the XM4s are REALLY comfy. I wear glasses with plastic frames and a lot of headphones just don't work and are really uncomfy. The Apple AirPods Max were really uncomfortable with my glasses. Obviously, an easy solution is to just wear contacts, but I hate wearing my contacts for long periods of time - especially, when I study/do work. The XM5 were also pretty comfortable, but wouldn't stay fixed when I adjusted them - they would slip and I would need to readjust them a lot. The XM4 completely cover my ear and the ear pads are soft. They don't squeeze my head the way other headphones do and they don't hurt any part of my ear. I will say that the headband part that rests on top of my head does kind of hurt my head after wearing them for almost 10 hours. Also, I have TMJ so sometimes wearing the headphones does cause my TMJ to flare up and I'll switch to earbuds. But, I think overall these are the most comfortable headphones I have tried.**Product Quality (3.5/5): let's be honest, they're plastic and they feel plastic. They don't feel like super high quality, but let me tell you that they feel way better quality than the XM5 - those felt like a barbie toy. I think the XM4 are sturdy and pretty durable. The Apple AirPods Max are also plastic, but do feel a little more high quality - but also, nothing spectacular.**Aesthetic (3.5/5): If the aesthetic is important to you, I would say they look fine. They're a little bulky, but not terrible. Not as sleek as some others, but they don't look ridiculous. If you're really against a bulky look, then they may not be a great aesthetic match for you. I was worried they would be really clunky, but after getting them and wearing them for a bit, I really don't think they look bad.**Connectivity (4/5): I only have Apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, etc.) and I think the connectivity is great with these products! When I got the XM5, they had so many connection issues. I wasn't able to connect them to my laptop, they wouldn't stay connected to my devices - it was a mess. I was really worried I would have the same issues with the XM4, but I have had no problems so far. I will say it was a little odd to have have to download the Sony Connect app and manage the headphone through that platform, but it's user friendly and it's kind of nice to have a control for them (it's almost like a remote).**Battery Life (5/5): The battery life is insane. I've had them for 8 days and have not charged them yet - they still have about 40% charge left. They will turn off automatically to save battery life if you don't use them for a certain amount of time, which I personally like.OVERALL (4.5/5): I think the XM4 are great headphones for a better price than the Apple AirPods Max. The Bose are apparently really similar, but I've never personally tried them. The XM4 is MUCH better than the XM5 in terms of quality and price. They're comfy, great noise cancellation and sound quality, and have great battery life.\n",
      "Customer Service: 5/5I purchased this item on Amazon through the seller Focus Camera.The pair I received had a volume defect that effected one side of the headphones constantly making it louder. After some firmware updates and messing with EQ, it was apparent that this was a manufacturer issue. However, when I went to try to initiate the return Amazon was only giving me the option of a full refund when I wanted an exchange. I then reached out to the seller who initiated an exchange for me without any further questions asked - In fact, I was surprised to have the shipping label in their initial reply.Product: 5/5Now that I have a new functioning unit, I can say these are some of the best all-around headphones available right now.As an Apple AirPods Pro user - and like many of you - I was discouraged at the price of Apple’s first branded headphone. No matter the quality, many of us can’t justify that price.I’ve been looking for a pair of wired-headphones for gaming use, video editing use (wired-in editing is the best for sound editing precision), and of course casual music listening use.As far as features, the gesture controls have worked accurately for me and I’ve welcomed the volume control which isn’t a feature on AirPods/AirPods Pro. Their companion app with built in EQ and detailed setting is a God-send for us Apple users who want more customization options in their products. The battery is as long as advertised and it’s nice knowing you don’t have to charge them daily (with my use). Speak-to-Chat is a great idea that has some real-world use cases. Noise Cancellation is probably the best in this mid-tier range of headphones. But if listening to your surroundings is most important to you be aware that the microphones used to listen to your environment - “Ambient Sound” Mode - seem to be located near the top of each headphone can and this appears to face up, as a result the ambient mode is not as effective as Apple’s AirPods Pro’s Transparency Mode (which I’ll assume that the same quality extends to the AirPods Max). The AirPods replicate your surrounding sounds perfectly in real-life quality as if you didn’t have anything in/on your ears. So big FYI; Apple is still king in “Transparency/Ambient” modes. Lastly, they’re extremely comfortable although your ears might get a little warm from the leatherette after prolonged use.I think price is important when considering the review of anything because it determines value. I bought these on sale for $278. With the price being so close to Apple AirPods Pro at $250, I personally feel I’m getting more than my money’s worth with a travel case, 3.5mm audio cable, charging cable, and airplane audio adapter all included with the cost at a great deal. These have a retail price of $350. So, given all of the above and the sound quality, I wouldn’t be particularly enthused or feeling like I got a great deal if I paid full-price for them but the convenience and rich sound make it a good investment nonetheless and almost all owners will be happy with them. But, I hope you understand that that means if these are on sale (especially for $250) then don’t even think about it. It’s a no-brainer Purchase them right away if you see them on sale!Lastly: Sound - The sound is great and highly customizable but the headphones themselves seem to lean towards warmer tones and more bass. Don’t worry, they’re not maxed out like the early-model Beats, but I recommend each user download their companion app and try EQ for the perfect balance. As long as you are aware that these aren’t the audiophile headphones for mixing professional music or films, nor the pair of workout/gym headphones, nor even the pair with noise cancellation that will make you sound like you’re in a soundproof room - then you’ll be happy. These headphones will not excel in any of these specific features, but that’s what makes these headphones the best over-all headphones. It’s a jack-of-all trades and so far one of my favorite Sony products ever made. I hope you enjoy yours as I’ve enjoyed mine.\n",
      "Honestly, there was a part of me that was worried that these headphones would not be the best pair to own after the issues that I experienced with the prior generation of them: the WH1000xm3. The main issue that I had? The build quality: the plastic around the headband snapped due to a flimsy connection, resulting in me having to tape both headbands together so that the headphones don't fall apart on me. I tried several alternate brands to see if they would work, but they never came close to giving me the same level of satisfaction while wearing them as the WH1000xm3 did, even with the taped headband taken into account. So I decided that the best replacement for a Sony headphone was another Sony headphone, and I invested in the M4, which succeeded the M3 last year (as of this writing).My initial thoughts were as follows: the headphones were a definite improvement upon the originals, retaining what I liked most about the original headphones (largely the overall comfort) while also improving the headphones in other small ways (especially in regards to the special features-the M4 are way more feature-packed than the M3 were, incorporating many elements that are being found on most other headphones these days). My favorite thing that was fixed, however, was the sound quality. You see, the original sounded amazing, and honestly sounded better overall than the likes of Bose and Sennheiser, which I have tested as potential replacements for the Sony headphones. And that is despite the fact that the headphones have a relatively small 40mm driver inside, instead of a more traditional 50mm driver. However, the one minor issue I had with the M3 was that the low frequencies were heightened a bit more than I would have liked, making songs sound a bit bass-heavy even when the EQ was turned off (the only way I was able to fix this was by setting the EQ to 'bright', which isn't ideal since the EQ does degrade the battery life). With the M4, Sony improves this by tuning down the low ends, resulting in the headphones having a very flat frequency response, which in turn results in every song having a much wider sound stage than the M3 did (and almost making them sound as good as the various open-back headphones I have tried, including the Sennheiser 650, which is my personal favorite open-back headphone).In terms of the special features, I think they were implemented quite well in these headphones. The noise cancelling is exceptional, much like it was on the M3, and the transparency mode is somehow even better than it was on the prior generation headphone, sounding a lot more natural and less tinny overall. The auto activation of transparency mode during conversations is fantastic, and enables me to talk to people naturally without ever having to remove the headphones from my ear. This also means that I don't have to awkwardly tap my hand on the earcup with the M4, either. The DSEE Extreme audio enhancer really helps to make music sound a lot more full, even when using devices that don't support the LDAC wireless standard. It isn't as good as listening to lossless files wired, mind you, but it is still an amazing feature that helps to take advantage of the flat sound stage and frequency response of the headphone drivers.Now, this isn't to say that these headphones don't have issues, mind you. The auto-pause when removing the headphones from your ears is very much a gimmick, and doesn't always pause the song (and may even resume the music before you have a chance to place the headphones back on your ear). Since the headphones use a light sensor to tell if you are wearing your headphones or not, it means even a simple shadow can cause the headphones to think that they are back on your ears and restart music playback. It is quite obnoxious, and it is best left out. Another, more minor issue is the touch controls. While I personally have no issue with them, I know that there are many people that don't like them whatsoever. So I will just make a note that they are still here, and they work in much the same way as they did on the M3. Finally, I should mention that the flat soundstage, while amazing for my listening experience, may not be for everyone. Bassheads in particular would likely prefer extra pronunciation on the lower ranges. And while they will never be quite as bass-heavy as the Skullcandy or Beats line, the EQ can still bring the bass levels up quite a bit, using a 'clear bass' slider that reminds me of the slider on the Skullcandy Skullcrushers: raising the bass without causing distortion.Overall, the headphones turned out to be quite an exceptional pair, especially when it comes to listening to music during commutes. The great noise cancelling, beautiful audio, and fantastic transparency mode definitely make these headphones a winner in my book. And the app only helps to improve the flexibility of the headphones, allowing for many different features to be unlocked. And while these headphones certainly have some issues (no pair of headphones are perfect, after all), I think the benefits more than outweigh the issues for me, and put these at the top of my list of best closed-back headphones that I have worn. Hopefully Sony will continue to make amazing headphones like these in the ears to come.\n",
      "I can't compare these to other sets in their class, what I can say is that they are so good, I don't even need to consider trying a different set. I use them at my desk for work as well as while traveling.For work, they are very, very comfortable and don't cause soreness or headaches like other headphones I have used in the past. I have gone thru multi day planning sessions where I was in meetings almost the entire day and they were excellent. I also love how I don't have to charge them when using the wire to connect them to my work laptop. Noise canceling doesn't work, but the fact that they are over the ear headphones as it is, I can't easily hear background noise from my home office.I recently took them on my first trip. The battery life was great, didn't need to recharge them the entire trip. The noise cancelling technology was absolutely fantastic, even if I didn't have any media playing they were solid. At times, I forgot I was even on a plane. The case for them is very good, holds them nicely and was sturdy enough to hold up while in my bag.\n",
      "UPDATE #2: After returning the first set of these headphones, I ordered another set on Prime Day and have now had a little more than a month to try them out.  Based on this experience so far, I'm raising the rating from 2 to 4 stars.  Trying not to jinx things, but the new unit does not have the right earcup static issue that plagued the first set (and that a not insignificant number of users have complained about).  I'm not sure whether one of the firmware updates addressed the issue or whether the first set had a hardware issue of some sort, but the new set has not had the issue.I now believe the \"bluetooth stopping for no reason\" issue noted in my prior update is not a defect, but the speak to chat feature, which stops the playback whenever it detects a human voice. I understand the point of this feature, but Sony should calibrate it better.  As it is, even when set on low sensitivity and not to focus on voice, it still stops playback at even low human voice volumes.  As a practical matter, this means you can't sing or hum along to songs without having the playback constantly cut off.  I've wound up disabling this feature.Other than that, the new headphones have been great -- super noise cancelling and music quality, decent phone call quality (maybe not best in class but more than serviceable), and day-in, day-out comfortable.  The only reason I didn't rate them at 5 stars is that this set, like the previous one, has a very high default volume, such that sometimes when you turn the headphones on, the music will start blasting out at an uncomfortably high volume. (I think that if you use another set of headphones, as I sometimes do, the XM4 will forget its last volume setting.)UPDATED:  I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy.  Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all).  At other times, there are skips or pops.  While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.PROS:1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose.  They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you're not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file.  When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world.  I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing.  A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it's still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have.  It's no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a \"feature\" of ANC headphones.2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used.  The ear pieces in particular are outstanding.  I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable.  However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable.  These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on.  I can comfortably wear these for hours.3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well.  I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.CONS:1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either).  The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music.  Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue.  I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone's bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file.  I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn't allow users to change it.  It's really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason.  For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.2) Phone call quality -- meh.  Some calls are good, others not so much.  Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality.  However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc.  Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better.  I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that's the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on.  However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.).  It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones.  However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have.  I'm likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.\n",
      "about the same as the xm3. the pairing aspect is nice and was my reason to upgrade. I couldn't take all the paring issues anymore, and having more control in my phone to move between all my computers was appreciated.The app does only pair to 2 devices, but it keeps a memory or  list of the devices you have paired to (it is not easy to find this information online). I should probably make some youtube video.  Having this management aspect makes these so much more usable. They should back-port this to xm3 as well even if only one device at a time software control is so helpful. I''m in software and have to switch computers and phones a lot.Otherwise, i the anc is superior to xm3, mildly so. For me the reason to upgrade is if you want excellent multiparing. Frankly it seems to just work better. Even single paring for me was always dicey on the xm3 there are some devices it just wouldn't pair with. Not the case with these. The sound and anc aren't really reasons to upgrade. they all sound fantastic.The lacking issue is still build quality. they look nice, but the qc 25/35 which i also own use metal in the hinges and i am certain will last longer from a build standpoint. I 've pretty much taken the xm3 apart, they are all plastic, and you better be careful.  That said these are so easy to work on. I have opened up my xm3's replaced the battery and pads and they are still going strong at almost 3 years now. I upgraded because i literally use these every day, i actually sleep in them and the multiparing was wearing on me. Given how much they are used it was worth it for me.As long as these sony continue to make great anc headphones, and keep them serviceable i'll continue to go sony. The tipping point is the sound vs bose. Don't get me wrong bose gets a really bad rep in my opinion. They are not bad in any way and still have better build quality and calls. sure they are a bluetooth headphone. I have high end stuff too they don't have that kind of detail. But you know what. These are the headphones i used. I don't especially like being tethered to a computer. Anyway with bose the sound just isn't as fun. For me when you using headpones with small speakers, you to tune warm unlike large receiver speakers. I could even say if your a bit older  losing your ability to detect highs maybe then bose makes sense, or your tastes are more for a flat neutral. the sound bose is good. However that's isn't me at all if i want that i'll have a chat with my wife. I don't want boomy but i do want a warm sound that's exciting. these are the best sounding bluetooth headphones with ANC i 've heard and they are plenty good enough for me. I will pretty much continue to live in my xm4 now at my desk and when i am out use my xm3s.  By the way i picked these on verizon for some insane deal. They were like 250 already. I'd wait for black friday. i was going to, but then that came up. 350's a lot for this build quality, but if you haven't used these and are on the fence amazon is good because of the return policy if you don't like them. I really do think this is one of those rare great products, and i have had so much use out of my xm3. the pause /turn off when take off is also wonderful. I had that on my plantronics and am glad they added that here. The speak to chat feature is also nice. I like the low sensitivity mode.I have ultimately decided good anc is so worth it. I have way lower stress. Just the other day i was working at home, and there is all this construction going on i didn't even notice it, and i could see how stressed out my wife was. I also have kids and dogs, I put these things on and I am like a bachelor. I use them everywhere card, yard worksconcentration, sleep. It's just fantastic technology. Even if your working out and you are on some loud exercise equipment you can use these and save your ears and hear the tv. They aren't waterproof, but i just put  on a fan when i am working out to prevent sweating and that works great.  I am also glad they aren't water proof so i can easily replace the battery for 15 dollars. It has a freaking plug and doesn't even need to be soldered. xm4 is the same. Get these. :)\n",
      "I am coming from a set of Bose QC15 and Sony MDR-7506 and wow!! Hats off to Sony for their MKIV headphones.Sony WH-1000XM4 has incredible sound and features!The active noice cancelling works GREAT!!! I put my head next to the wall AC unit and can barely hear a thing.Compared to my QC15, the Sony is so much better at ANC you'd think the Bose were turned off. Don't get me wrong, I've loved my QC15 on a daily basis for over ten years but comparing these are like night and day.Music from Sony WH-1000XM4 sounds rich and full in a way that I've only heard at a movie theatre and the Bose QC15 and MDR-7506 are no schlubs; I'm used to decent headphones. The custom EQ that you can set and upload to the Sony WH-1000XM4 using their proprietary app is everything. Very intuitive and easy to use and you don't even NEED the app if you just want to use them out of the box and not futz with settings, it can pair like any normal bluetooth device by holding down the power button; however, the app does everything automatically.Compared to AirPods Pro, the ability to tune every feature versus just on/off makes me feel like I have a quality high-end device versus a kind of generic one. Not to get off topic, but I returned the AirPods Pro; they are nice but not for the money. I felt that AirPods Pro FUNCTIONED very very well (Good ANC, brilliant pairing, can use either left, or right, or both, and the auto on/off/pause/play works like a charm) but I thought that they missed the mark on sound quality, comfort, and battery life just enough that I didn't feel that they were worth $200+.Spoiler Alert, I went with Bose QC Earbuds but that's another story.Getting back on topic...The Sony WH-1000XM4 are worth every cent. I scored mine on Prime Day and got a great deal on them!!They're worth MSRP... but try for less. I got them for $75 off MSRP Oct 14, 2020 and they did free next day delivery.There's my obligatory plug, where's my gift card?Oh, right. It was in the box with my headphones, duh. lol. (they gave me a gift card for Prime Day)The thing that surprised me the MOST about the Sony WH-1000XM4 are how well they perform as a headset. Whatever gadgetry they've packed in these is pretty magical. When on a phone call or FaceTime, the headset WHILE KEEPING ANC ACTIVE, makes it so I can hear myself speak and therefore am not shouting while on the phone like I typically am. WHILE ANC IS STILL WORKING. Magical.The auto I/O/Play/Pause feature when you remove them from your head is very nice too.Very happy about multipoint bluetooth. I have it set to work with my iPhone and Sony X950H TV and it's seamless.I was actually waiting for them to upgrade to having this and is why I didn't go for the MKIII. Glad I waited.The case is nice and holds all of the accessories plus a few more tiny ones that I had for other travel things. The case fits perfectly in my laptop bag (Brenthaven Elliot Deluxe) and does not make it any bulkier or bulgy. The case is actually smaller than the one for my QC15 because the Sony WH-1000XM4 fold up! Bonus!!USB-C charging instead of Micro-USB is superb, I am very much enjoying the rapid charge feature and since I plan on having these for a long time, the port is a sturdy one that will take many many many plugging/unpluggings.Battery life seems to function as advertised, although I haven't timed it for 30 hours, I just charge it at the end of the night. If I forget to, no worries, it's charged enough for the day by the time I am done getting ready to go.All in all, very happy with the Sony WH-1000XM4. Five stars!\n",
      "A disclaimer: I received this product as part of Amazon’s Vine program.  While I didn’t pay for the item, the review is totally my personal, unbiased review.  Neither Amazon, nor the vendor has influenced this review in any way.ProsExcellent noise cancellingVery good sound quality for all Bluetooth profiles (Listening to music, phone/video calls)Battery lifeExcellent Bluetooth rangeAutomatic voice detection to pause music and enter transparency modeConsTouch controls are simply awful!Dual Bluetooth device supportConstant beeps and noise cancelling turned off especially with “Detection of Actions” enabledVoice detection for stopping music and going into a transparency mode responds to almost any sound you make.  A large breath, grunt, anything will trigger this feature.Rubs on the “helix” outer part of the ear on the left earSomewhat complex set up processOverall these are really excellent Bluetooth headphones.  The noise cancellation is absolutely excellent.  This is probably the best noise-cancelling headphone available.  The Bluetooth range is also exceptional.  Audio quality for music is also very good, and I expect most people will find them to be excellent. Phone/video call audio is also good receiving, and acceptable for the microphone.  They have long battery life and charge quickly.  They are relatively comfortable as well. The touch user controls are simply dreadful.  There are many other features with a range of benefit.Comfort:They seem comfortable, and the ear pads are soft and plush.  However after several hours the outside of my ears start to hurt from rubbing on the insides of the headphones (the area called helix on top of the ear rubs on the inside of the left ear around optical sensor area.)  If at sometime we resume taking long international flights this could be an even larger issue.They are still comfortable though when wearing them with glasses.  They ear pads are pliant enough to continue to make a good seal without painfully pushing them into your head.Bluetooth, Pairing, Multiple devices:These support 2 Bluetooth devices to be connected simultaneously.  The Bose QC35 has had this feature for some time.  I initially paired my iPhone X with the headphones.  I then added a MacBook Pro from within the Connect app.  I was then able to play music from the MacBook.  I went back to the iPhone and tried to play something.  It didn’t immediately play. In fact, it is rather finicky.  Sometimes starting something with audio on the iPhone will cause audio to switch.  Mostly it doesn’t if something is playing already on one device.  Stopping the audio, waiting, and then starting the audio on the phone is a bit more reliable. Even if the source on one device is paused and not playing it may not switch back.This is a bit problematic though since the iPhone still thinks it is connected to a Bluetooth headphone, so the audio is still routed to the Sony WH-1000MX4, but isn’t played – so it goes no where.  This works far more seamlessly on the Bose QC35.  I actually found myself disabling this feature half the time.While the WH-1000MX4 does have voice announcements, it doesn’t speak the name of the device.  It will say “Bluetooth device 1 connected,” whereas the Bose QC35 will speak “Joe’s iPhone.” Even more confusing is that device 1 and device 2 doesn’t always refer to the same device.  Sometimes my iPhone is device 1 and other times it is device 2.  The only way to really know is to go into the app where it will identify the device associated with device 1 and device 2.I added a 3rd Bluetooth device, again from the app.  This works, but will disconnect one of the 2 already connected devices.  It works pretty much like most Bluetooth devices.  You disconnect at least one of the currently connected devices and then connect the new device.  You can have multiple devices paired, but a maximum of 2 devices currently connected.  You can see the list of devices within the Connect app.Bluetooth range is excellent.  It would easily stay connected when going from one area of a reasonably large house to another.  The range exceeds any other Bluetooth headphones.Sound Quality:Sound quality has to be the most subjective area to evaluate, yet one of the most important. Most people will find these really very good to excellent.  For most these may well be the best sounding headphones they have ever had. Those more critical may find a few areas where they lack, but still they are excellent for noise cancelling headphones.  Sound quality is probably one of the best aspects of these headphones.The sound quality when listening to high quality content was very enjoyable.  Overall they are fairly well balanced, albeit a bit heavy on the low end, but not boomy or with obvious peaks in the response.  More so they sound “warm.” The bass is noticeable, and quite deep.  You will clearly hear the thump of a drum, but still somewhat tight.  The deep bass on some of the Billie Eilish tracks is impressive. The bass is not so excessive though that it drowns out mid or high frequencies.  Music sounds good with individual instruments clearly identified.  Male and female vocals sound good and natural.The deep warm bass works well for movies and similar entertainment.  These will likely work quite well for watching airplane entertainment.  High frequencies are clear, and more smooth than harsh. They are balanced overall with a bit more low frequency emphasis that shifts the balance a bit.The iPhone app does have equalization settings, so it is possible to adjust to your personal preferences.  I reviewed these set at flat, default setting.If one is going to compare these to audiophile headphones they will clearly notice differences. They will not replace examples of the best open or closed back audiophile headphones.  They simply lack the detail, imaging and placement that those headphones present when paired with a quality DAC and headphone amplifier.  That really isn’t a fair comparison though as these are noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones and they do a great job at that.I did listen through both Bluetooth with the AAC codec and wired with a quality external DAC while listening to high resolution content streamed from Tidal through a Master Quality Authenticated DAC. They do sound better with the same content played through a wired DAC than Bluetooth.  The difference wasn’t as much was expected. Sony did a good job with Bluetooth.  I also tried listening to them with the power off, as plain wired headphones.  They didn’t sound that different, which is rather a good thing.  The same experiment with Bose QC35s will have a totally different sound.  Bose relies extensively on equalization to get their otherwise somewhat poor sounding headphones to sound good.  Sony starts out with decent sounding drivers.I have not tried using the LDAC hi-resolution Bluetooth codec yet.  This isn’t as easy as it would seem to use on either iOS or MacOS.  You can’t simply use a high-resolution source to use it.  You need to download and install the Sony Music Center app, then load the high-resolution content into that app to play.  I’m not sure how to get it to work with a Mac at all. The better codec should sound better.  To be fair, at least part of the problem is Apple in this case.I did try the DSEE Extreme feature.  This supposedly improves the sound quality of low bit rate compressed content.  I listened to some low bit rate MP3 files, and some standard streaming services, such as Amazon Prime music.  It sounded different, I’m not sure I would say it sounded better.  At least what I noticed was a boost in high frequencies.  It made some of the squashed high frequency details more noticeable, but they still sounded highly compressed, and to some extent the compression artifacts became more noticeable.  This may well be a personal choice, and likely varies over content, level of compression, and codecs used.  The bottom line is that you really need to start with quality content.The 360 Reality Audio was a disappointment. I tried playing a variety of tracks in 360 Reality Audio on Tidal.  I did this using the Tidal app on both iPhone and a Mac. I did link the Tidal app with the Sony app as part of the initial setup.  I did notice a wider sound stage. It wasn’t like demos in a movie theater for Dolby Atmos or anything that dramatic.  There was some front/rear placement depth.  It was interesting to play with for a while.  What I found though is that it just sounded strange.  I played some of the same tracks on Tidal HiFi or MQA and to me they sounded much better, much more musical.  Call me a purist, audiophile, or whatever, but I found the highly processed audio more annoying than enjoyable.  It doesn’t replace the stereo imaging or placement that superb headphones can present as described above.  Honestly overall these sound good enough without these audio tricks.  Perhaps if there were some movie encoded with 360 Audio it would be better to enjoy special effects and less about musicality. It seems more of a gimmick than musical.  By far the best quality was the same song in Master Quality on Tidal with an external DAC and the 3.5mm wired cable.Phone callsThe audio quality on phone and video calls has been excellent on the receiving side and is about as good as Bluetooth HFP profile gets. it is excellent for conversations.  With the excellent noise cancellation these are excellent for long video calls.  They will likely continue to be great for those forced to endure a noisy open office environment, or need to make phone calls in a noisy area such as an airport or train station.Phone call microphone:Overall I’ve had only a few complaints from those that I’ve in meetings or on calls with.  Most people said I sounded fine.  I was on one phone call with my iPhone and the person had difficulty understanding me and could hear me fine when I switched to the iPhone.  They said I sounded “far away.”  On a video call I had some people refer to the sound as “bubbly.” After switching to AirPod Pros and the sound improved.They seem to isolate ambient noise reasonably well, although I haven’t had extreme cases to try during working from home due to COVID-19.  This is one area where Bose QC35 were awful. I don’t know if they match AirPod Pro for microphone beam forming, but so far they seem fine. These work for phone and video calls, but aren’t great.Noise cancellationThese are fantastic at noise cancellation.  I haven’t been on an airplane with them, the real test, but these seem significantly better than the already excellent Bose QC35.  At least around the house they block out the low frequency sounds that noise-cancelling headphones are best at. Around the house even a Ninja blender was mostly attenuated while I was on a conference call.  My neighbor’s air conditioner that still can be heard with the Bose QC35 and AirPod Pros is completely gone with these.  I was even using a really loud flooring saw and used these.  I did still hear the saw, but not very loud, and I could still enjoy music while sawing flooring!  Family talking is mostly gone during conference calls and entirely when playing music.  I expect that these would be great in an open office environment or an airplane.  Bose QC35 were the best I had used prior to these, and the Bose don’t work nearly as well, especially for voice.  They have much better noise cancellation than Apple Air Pod Pro buds too. If your main reason for looking for headphones is noise cancellation, these are what you buy.One annoyance I had with the Bose QC35 headphones is if I wore glasses the sidepieces would create an acoustic leak and let some noise in. They still work, but especially on an airplane you would hear more air noise. I haven’t tried them on an airplane yet due to covid, but so far I don’t notice nearly as much difference as I did with the Bose with glasses.Battery:Sony claims 20 hours of battery life without defining what mode. Other headphones sometimes have decreased battery life with HFP (phone calls).  These definitely exceed the rated battery life.  With the first charge they lasted almost a week of varied use.  I used them for a multi-day virtual conference, and other meetings (combination of HFP and A2DP) for over 14 hours, and they still had 60% charge.  Sony doesn’t specify any longer battery life with the wired cable.  On the Bose I would plug the cable in when I would go to sleep on international flights, and Bose quoted 40 hours like that, so 20 hours isn’t fantastic.  It is more than enough though.  It will get you through the longest flight plus some other use.  Almost any other use it should be more than enough.  I used them over 10 hours straight one day and they were still around 70% charged.Charging:These charge with a USB-C connector.  They come with a very short (about 6”) USB-A to C cable but no power supply.  They charge relatively quickly (less than an hour from 20%, but I didn’t time it).  You will need around a 10W power supply to get the fastest charging.  I monitored the charge current from 20% capacity.  They started at 0.44A or roughly 2.2W, which seemed reasonable for headphones. Then they jumped to 1.32A or about 6.66W, then to the maximum I saw was 1.8A or about 9 W! It is surprising that Sony pushed that much power into a headphone! The actually battery capacity has to be pretty large, so it apparently does use quite a bit of power.  In most cases this is of no issue, they charge up quick.  It can be an issue is if you are stuck trying to charge them in an airport or airplane port. They will also suck a lot out of a battery pack.User interface:This is the worst aspect of these headphones.  The touch controls are simply dreadful, almost unusable.  Simple buttons would have been much better.  Even with practice it is almost impossible to master the gestures to go forward, backward, start/stop, and change the volume. Either it doesn’t register the touch, or it does the wrong thing.  You try and turn the volume down and track changes.  To be fair, they do have a volume control.  The Air Pods Pro don’t and that is really annoying. Even with practice controls don’t work right.Some guidance: to change the volume, especially lower it, swipe down on the right ear as if you are petting it. Just swiping as if using a smartphone touch screen won’t work right.  Swipe down from above the top just like petting it, and then it might change the volume.  Changing tracks is even harder, and only seems to happen when trying to change the volume.  Hitting the start stop button doesn’t seem to work, except of course when you try to adjust the headphone on your head and then it stops what you were listening to, and would likely hang up a call – be careful of that.  I end up using controls on my phone or computer most times.  Simple buttons would have been SO much better.Voice assistant:Setting up Alexa is not all that easy. Assuming the headphones are already set for Alexa, you already have the Alexa app installed and set up, and the headphones are already paired to the phone you still need to add the WH1000MX4 to Alexa. This takes going to the Alexa app, and adding the device.  It will then want to pair with Bluetooth.  I put the WH1000MX4 into pairing mode by using the almost hidden mode of holding the power button (rather than the app). It then showed it failed to connect, but it actually seemed to pair on the second attempt.  If you were successful you will have a second pairing of the device as LE_-WH1000XM4, for a second Bluetooth Low Energy pairing.Then Alexa did work hands free (if enabled in the Alexa app).  You could just say Alexa and it worked.  You could ask Alexa what ever you normally would.  It seemed to actually work better than the Echo Auto that also relies on the app.  The response audio always has the first syllable of cut off though.  This works fine for querying Alexa, or invoking Alexa content.  It does NOT work for controlling other functions on the phone, even changing the volume.  Telling Alexa to play won’t resume what was playing on the phone, it will resume what the Alexa app used last it seems.  This may be iPhone limitations, but I will likely switch to Siri and see if that works better.  It would be great if you could have all of them and just invoke the desired one with the appropriate wake word (Alexa, Hey Siri, OK Google).  I haven’t tried other voice assistants with these yet.The automatic speak to chat feature is both great and annoying.  At least with the sensitivity set to automatic it will detect voice quite well and stop the content you may be listening to, and allow ambient sound to be heard.  This, when desired is far more convenient than Air Pods Pro where you have to hold be button for a few seconds to go into transparency mode.  While you still can’t hear what someone says to you, at least when you reply to them, it immediately lets you hear them, and doesn’t take the seconds the Air Pods do. With AirPods you also need 2 actions to stop music and enter transparency mode.  This mostly works.  In the automatic mode it doesn’t need to actually be voice that triggers it.  Anything like a grunt, large breath, anything it seems will trigger it. The slightest grunt or sound and they stopped the music and went into ambient mode.  There is a low sensitivity mode that I haven’t tried yet.  You will find this feature to be a love/hate relationship after a while.  Even with the “Focus on Voice” feature enabled this still seems to be overly sensitive.Another feature is adaptive sound control.  This is supposed to optimize the sound based on location, and detection of actions.  This is likely useful when changing between an office, train station, etc.  I haven’t evaluated that during a pandemic.As for automatic detection of actions, that can be very annoying.  It was fine when sitting in one place. Initially I didn’t know why EVERY time I bent down the headphones would beep and go out of noise cancelling mode. Then resume playing normally. This is apparently the notification for detection of actions.  This can be disabled in the app.  If someone were to use these headphones in a gym or exercising this would be annoying as well.  (Note: These are NOT sport headphones!) AppThe app is essential to setting up, using, adjusting, and updating the headphones.  Sony even uses the app for pairing with the iPhone, which is unusual.  The app allows configuring the many options available, equalization and more.  You also use the app to optimize the headphones for the shape of your ears by taking a picture of your head and both ears.  I went through the whole process.There are a lot of options in the app, and the layout is OK.  It can be a bit confusing.The app does provide a lot of control and information.  It shows battery level, and the current codec in use.  This last part I really like, Apple typically doesn’t show these details.  Many options can beyond simply being enabled or disabled from the app can also be further controlled.Case, accessoriesA nice rigid fabric coated and lined travel case is provided. It is similar in size to the Bose QC35.  It appears that it would protect the headphones and hold up well with travel.A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable is included. This allows using the headphones with a wired source, such as an airplane entertainment system.  The cable does not have a microphone or controls and will not control and iPhone, iPad, or Mac or support calling.  It is only a 3-conductor plug for stereo listening.While the Bose QC35 headphones come with an equivalent cable, the Bose QC25 cable, or the Amazon Basics alternative cable can be purchased that does allow using the QC35 for phone calls, and wired remote.Also included is a short USB-A to USB-C charge cable, no charger, and the old 2-pin airplane adapter.\n",
      "I spent more on these headphones than I ever have on a pair of headphones before, so I was hoping that on top of the normal duties of a pair of headphones, that they would also wash my dishes and walk my dog for me ect. To be fair, they are probably the best headphones I've ever owned (which they should be as they're like double the price of the last 'expensive' pair I bought), but they didn't really wow me either.The noise cancelling and sound quality is generally fine. I'm a bassist, so if the bass is emphasized, I'm happy. I don't really notice the bass to be particularly heavy. I can usually distinctly hear bass lines if I make a conscious effot, but they don't tend to overpower (which I prefer, but I know a lot of people don't). I haven't messed around with the equalizer much so I can't speak to that. My issue with the sound quality is in the ambient sound mode. The ambient sound mode makes the ambient sounds sound horrible. This is largely my first experience with noise cancelling, so I don't have anything to compare it to, maybe we just don't have the tech yet to amplify sounds and not make them sound tinney and horrible. But yeah, it legit sounds like I'm listening to the world through a tin can. As a result I rarely use the ambient sound mode (this mode has noise cancelling but allows for some noises to come through) and rather just use the noise cancelling mode when I want to be aware of my surroundings.These headphones have several annoying features that if I knew I'd dislike so much I would've gone for another pair of headphones. First, the touch controls. Apparently there are some people out there who like the touch controls, but are they really necessary when buttons exist? Touch controls only make sense when there is a screen you can look at or at least some sort of tactile cue that reassures you that you're doing the thing you want to be doing. The two most important functions (on/off, and sound cancelling level) are controlled by real buttons, but pause, skip, and volume are all controlled by touch controls on the outside surface of the right headphone. Unless you are sitting perfectly still these are pretty much impossible to use and can result in unwanted pauses and skips. The #1 time I wear these is when I walk/run my dog. I cannot use the touch controls when I'm running and can occasionally use them while I'm walking, but they tend to be very imprecise. So to turn up the volume I have to do the motion like 3 times until I accidentally skip the song instead. This isn't a rare problem where most of the time I can use them fine. This happens the vast majority of times I try to use the touch controls when I'm moving - I'm actually pleasantly surprised if I can do the correct gesture while walking. Some people may argue that I have failed to learn how to use the touch controls (I've had these headphones for 6+ months), but there really shouldn't be a learning curve for being able to pause music - this is a design failure.I also wear these to the gym quite often. The other problem that I have with the touch controls is that I cannot do any sort of exercise with my arms overhead (pull ups, overhead press, ect.) with these on because my shoulder will touch the outside surface and pause or skip. I usually end up taking them off for my set.So, if you're the least bit hesitant about the touch controls, I'd say check out your other options because if I knew they'd be this frustrating I would've bought different headphones.The second overall problem I have with these headphones is how much talking they do. So you'd think, turn them on and play music, right? No, its turn them on, it says \"Power on\". Then it tells you \"Bluetooth connected\" - cool, good to know I can now turn on my music and listen... Unless I have a second device nearby and it says \"Bluetooth second device connected\". Then (because I'm walking my dog away from my second device) it plays a sound to tell me that device has been disconnected. Then I change the noise cancelling level... \"Ambient sound\" which sounds bad so I press the button again... \"Ambient Sound control off\". The robot talks so damn slow, it's literally like a minute of messing around before I can just listen to my music. Y'all really couldn't abbreviate any of this or make it talk faster? And if I want to change the noise cancelling level while listening to music or a podcast I best pause the song otherwise I'll miss half of it listening to the robot tell me what I know I'm doing and can hear the difference between. This is all a bit of an exaggeration, but it's enough to frustrate me. For a $300 pair of headphones I think I have the right to be impatient.Another minor thing that might not actually be the fault of the headphones is they have trouble with certain apps. Sometimes I'll press play on my phone but it won't play through the headphones for like 10 seconds or sometimes more (which is enough time to make me think something is wrong). Again, the headphones could be innocent here - they tend to work fine with the Apple Music app, but not the Apple Podcast app. I'm leaning towards blaming the app.Also the headphones generally comfy to wear. I have a small head, and they can fall off if I'm laying down but its not a huge issue.Overall, these are good headphones, but they have some design choices that make the headphones annoying to use which is frustrating for the price. If these break I won't buy another pair and would likely look for ones that don't have touch control, but I didn't think these issues were enough of a problem to get a refund or anything.\n"
